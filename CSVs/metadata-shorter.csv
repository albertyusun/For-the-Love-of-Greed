N. for Henry Herringman, at 〈…〉 in the Lower Walk of the New Exch〈…〉  Page  [unnumbered]Page  [unnumbered]THE PUBLISHER To the Reader. HAving been allowed the Liberty of Perusing the following Pa∣per at my own Lodging; I found my self strongly tempted, by the Strangeness of the things men∣tion'd in it, to venture to Release it: The know∣ledge I had of the Author's Inclination to Gra∣tifie the Virtuosi, forbidding me to despair of his pardon, if the same disposition prevail'd with me, to make the Curious Partakers with me of so Surprising a Piece of Philosophical Page  [unnumbered] News. And, though it sufficiently appear'd, that the insuing Conference was but a Conti∣nuation of a larger Discourse; yet, considering, that this Part consists chiefly, not to say only, of a Narrative; which (if I may so speak) stands upon its own legs, without any need of depend∣ing upon any thing that was deliver'd before; I thought it was no great Venture, nor Incon∣gruity, to let it come abroad by it self. And, I the less scrupled to make this Publication, be∣cause I found, that the Honorable Mr. Boyle confesses himfelf to be Fully Satisfied of the Truth, of as much of the Matter of Fact, as delivers the Phoenomena of the Tryal; the Truth whereof was further Confirm'd to me, by the Testimony, and Particular Account, which that most Learned and Experienc'd Phy∣sitian, who was Assistant to Pyrophilus in ma∣king the Experiment, and with whom I have the honor to be Acquainted (being now in Lon∣don) gave me with his own Mouth, of all the Circumstances of the Tryal. And, where the Page  [unnumbered] Truth of that shall be once Granted, there is little cause to doubt, that the Novelty of the thing will sufficiently Indear the Relation: es∣pecially to those that are studious of the Higher Arcana of the Hermetick Philosophy. For, most of the Phoenomena here mention'd, will probably seem wholly new, not only to vulgar Chymists, but also to the greatest part of the more knowing Spagyrists, and Natural Phi∣losophers themselves: none of the Orthodox Authors, as far as I can remember, having taken notice of such an Anti-Elixir. And, though Pyrophilus's Scrupulousness (which makes him very unwilling to speak the utmost of a thing) allowes it to be a Deterioration into an Imperfect Mettal onely; yet, to tell the truth, I think it was more Imbas'd than so; for the part left of it (and kept for some farther Discoveries) which I once got a sight of, looks more like a Mineral, or Marchasite, then like any Imperfect Mettal: and therefore this De∣gradation is not the same, but much greater, Page  [unnumbered] than that which Lullius doth intimate in some places. These Considerations make me presume it will easily be granted, That the Effects of this Anti-Philosophers Stone, as I think it may not unfitly be call'd., will not only seem very strange to Hermetick, as well as other Philosophers, but may prove very Instructive to Speculative Wits; especially if Pyrophilus shall please to acquaint them with that more odd Phoenomenon, which he Mentions darkly in the Close of his Discourse. Page  1AN Historical Account OF THE DEGRADATION OF GOLD BY AN Anti-Elixir. AFter the whole Company had, as it were by Common Consent, continued silent for some time, which others spent in Reflections up∣on the Preceding Conference, and Pyrophy∣lus, in the Consideration of what he was about to Deliver; this Virtuoso at length stood up, and Addressing himself to the rest, I hope, Gentlemen, sayes he, that what has been already Discoursed, has Inclin'd, if not Perswaded you to Think, Page  2 That the Exaltation, or Change of other Metals into Gold, is not a thing Absolutely Impossible; and, though I con∣fess, I cannot remove all your Doubts, and Objections, or my own, by being able to Affirm to you, That I have with my own hands made Projection (as Chymists are wont to call the Sudden Transmutation made by a small quanti∣ty of their Admirable Elixir) yet I can Confirm much of what hath been Argued for the Possibility of such a sudden Change of a Metalline Body, by a Way, which, I presume, will surprize you. For, to make it more credible, that other Metals are capable of being Graduated, or Exalted into Gold by way of Projection; I will Relate to you, that by the like way, Gold has been Degraded, or Imbased. The Novelty of this Preamble having much surprised the Auditory, at length, Simplicius, with a disdainful Smile, told Pyrophilus,That the Company would have much thanked him, if he could have assured them, That he had seen ano∣ther Mettal Exalted into Gold; but, that to find a way of spoiling Gold, was not onely an Useless Discovery, but a Prejudicial Practice. Pyrophilus was going to make some Return to this Animad∣version, when he was prevented by Aristander; who, turn∣ing himself to Simplicius, told him, with a Countenance and Tone that argued some displeasure; If Pyrophilus had been Discoursing to a Company of Goldsmiths, or of Merchants, your severe Reflection upon what he said would have been proper: but, you might well have forborn it, if you had considered, as I suppose he did, that he was speaking to an Assembly of Philosophers and Virtuosi, who are wont to esti∣mate Experiments, not as they inrich Mens Purses, but their Brains, and think Knowledge especially of uncommon things very desirable, even when 'tis not accompanyed with any other thing, than the Light that still attends it, and indears it. It hath been thought an Useful Secret, by Page  3 a kind of Retrogradation to turn Tin and Lead into brit∣tle Bodies, like the Ores of those Metals. And if I thought it proper, I could shew, that such a change might be of use in the Investigation of the Nature of those Metals, besides the practical use that I know may be made of it. To find the Nature of Wine, we are assisted, not only by the me∣thods of obtaining from it a Spirit; but by the ways of readily turning it into Vinegar: the knowledge of which ways hath not been despised by Chymists or Physitians, and hath at Paris, and divers other places, set up a profi∣table Trade. 'Tis well known that divers eminent Spagy∣rists have reckon'd amongst their highest Arcana the ways by which they pretended, (and I fear did but pretend) to Extract the Mercury of Gold, and consequently destroy that Metal; and 'twere not hard to shew by particular in∣stances, that all the Experiments wherein Bodies are in some respects deteriorated, are not without distinction to be rejected or despis'd; since in some of them, the Light they may afford may more than countervail the Degrada∣tion of a small quantity of matter, though it be Gold it self. And indeed, (continues he) if we will consider things as Philosophers, and look upon them as Nature hath made them, not as Opinion hath disguised them; the Prerogatives and usefulness of Gold, in comparison of other Metals, is nothing near so great as Alchymists and Usurers imagine. For, as it is true, that Gold is more ponderous, and more fix'd, and perhaps more difficult to be spoiled, than Iron; yet these qualities (whereof the first makes it burthensom, and the two others serve chiefly but to distinguish the true from counterfeit) are so balan∣ced by the hardness, stiffness, springiness, and other use∣ful qualities of Iron; that if those two Metals I speak of, (Gold and Iron) were equally plentiful in the World, it is scarce to be doubted, but that Men would prefer the Page  4 more useful before the more splendid, considering how much worse it were for Mankind to want Hatchets, and Knives and Swords, than Coin and Plate? Wherefore, (concludes he) I think Pyrophilus ought to be both desi∣red and incouraged to go on with his intended Discourse, since whether Gold be or not be the Best of Metals; an assu∣rance that it may be degraded, may prove a Novelty very Instructive, and perhaps more so than the Transmutation of a baser Metal into a Nobler. For I remember it hath long pass'd for a Maxim among Chymical Philosophers, That Facilius est aurum construere quam destruere: And whatever becomes of that, 'tis certain that Gold being the closest, the constantest, and the least destructible of Metals, to be able to work a notable and almost Essential change in such a Body, (though, by detereorating it) is more than to work a like change, (though in popular esti∣mation for the better) in any Metal less indisposed to ad∣mit alterations, especially in such an one as Pyrophilus inti∣mates, by telling us, that 'twas made by Way of Projection, and consequently by a very small proportion of active matter; whereas the destructions that vulgar Chymists pretend to make of Gold, are wont to be attempted to be made by considerable proportions of Corrosive Men∣struums, or other fretting Bodies; and even these, Expe∣rience shews to be usually too weak to ruine, though some¦times they may much disguise the most Stable Texture of Gold. Cuncta adeo miris illic complexibus haerent.  Pyrophilus perceiving by several signs that he needed not add any thing of Apologetical to what Arristander had already said for him, resumed his Discourse, by saying, I was go¦ing, Gentlemen, when Simplicius diverted me, to tell you That looking upon the Vulgar Objections that have been wont to be fram'd against the possibility of Metalline Transmutations, from the Authority and Prejudices of Page  5Aristotle, and the School-Philosophers, as Arguments that in such an Assembly as this need not now be solemnly discuss'd; I consider that the difficulties that really de∣serve to be call'd so, and are of weight even with Mecha∣nical Philosophers, and Judicious Naturalists, are princi∣pally these. First, That the great change that must be wrought by the Elixir, (if there be such an Agent) is effected upon Bodies of so stable and almost immutable a Nature as Metals. Next, That this great change is said to be brought to pass in a very short time. And thirdly, (which is yet more strange) That this great and suddain alteration is said to be effected by a very small, and per∣haps inconsiderable, proportion of the transmuting Pow∣der. To which three grand difficulties, I shall add ano∣ther that to me appears, and perhaps will seem to divers of the new Philosophers, worthy to be lookt upon as a fourth, namely, The notable change that must by a real transmutation be made in the Specifick Gravity of the matter wrought upon: which difficulty I therefore think not unworthy to be added to the rest, because upon seve∣ral tryals of my own and other men, I have found no known quality of Gold, (as its colour, malleableness, fixi∣ty, or the like) so difficult, if not so impossible, to be in∣troduc'd into any other Metalline Matter, as the great Specifick Gravity that is peculiar to Gold. So that, Gen∣tlemen, (concludes Pyrophilus) if it can be made appear that Art has produc'd an Anti-Elixir, (if I may so call it) or Agent that is able in a very short time, to work a very no∣table, though deteriorating, change upon a Metal; in proportion to which, its quantity is very inconsiderable; I see not why it should be thought impossible that Art may also make a true Elixir, or Powder capable of speedily Transmuting a great proportion of a baser Metal into Sil∣ver or Gold: especially if it be considered, that those Page  6 that treat of these Arcana, confess that 'tis not every mat∣ter which may be justly called the Philosophers Stone, that is able to transmute other Metals in vast quantities; since several of these Writers, (and even Lully himself) make differing orders or degrees of the Elixir, and ac∣knowledge, that a Medicine or Tincture of the first or lowest order will not transmute above ten times its weight of an Inferior Metal. Pyrophilus having at this part of his Discourse made a short pawse to take breath, Crattippus took occasion from his si∣lence to say to him, I presume, Pyrophilus, I shall be dis∣avowed by very few of these Gentlemen, if I tell you that the company is impatient to hear the Narrative of your Experiment, and that if it do so much as probably make out the particulars you have been mentioning, you will in likelyhood perswade most of them, and will cer∣tainly oblige them all. I shall therefore on their behalf as well as my own, sollicite you to hasten to the Histori∣cal part of a Discourse that is so like to gratifie our Cu∣riosity. The Company having by their unanimous silence, testified their approbation of what Crattippus had said; and appearing more than ordinarily attentive, As I was one day abroad; saith Pyrophilus, to return vi∣sits to my Friends, I was by a happy Providence (for it was beside my first Intention) directed to make one to an Ingenious Foreigner, with whom a few that I had received from him, had given me some little acquaintance. Whilst this Gentleman and I were discoursing together of several matters, there came in to visit him a stranger, whom I had but once seen before; and though that were in a promiscuous company, yet he addressed himself to me in a way that quickly satisfied me of the greatness of his Civility; which he soon after also did of that of his Curio∣sity. Page  7 For the Virtuoso, in whose Lodgings we met, having (to gratifie me) put him upon the discourse of his Voyages; the curious stranger entertained us an hour or two with pertinent and judicious Answers to the Questions I askt him-about places so remote, or so much within Land, that I had not met with any of our English Navigators or Tra∣vellers that had penetrated so far as to visit them. And be∣cause I found by his discourse that I was like to enjoy such good company but a very little while, (since he told me that he came the other day into England but to dispatch a business which he had already done as far as he could do it, after which he was with speed to return, as (to my trouble) he did to his Patron that sent him) I made the more haste to propose such Questions to him, as I most desired to be satisfied about; and among other things, enquiring whe∣ther in the Eastern parts he had travers'd, he had met with any Chymists; he answered me that he had; and that though they were fewer, and more reserved than ours, yet he did not find them all less skilful. And on this occasion, before he left the Town to go aboard the Ship he was to over∣take; he in a very obliging way put into my hands at part∣ing a little piece of Paper, folded up; which he said con∣tained all that he had left of a rarity he had received from an Eastern Virtuoso, and which he intimated would give me occasion both to Remember him, and to exercise my thoughts in uncommon Speculations. The great delight I took in conversing with a Person that had travelled so far, and could give me so good an account of what he had seen, made me so much resent the being so soon deprived of it, that though I judg'd such a Vertuoso would not, as a great token of his kindness, have presented me a trifle, yet the Present did but very imperfectly con∣soal me for the loss of so pleasing and instructive a Conver∣sation. Page  8 Nevertheless, that I might comply with the curiosity he himself had excited in me, and know how much I was his Debtor, I resolved to see what it was he had given me, and try whether I could make it do what I thought he Intima∣ted, by the help of those few hints rather than directions how to use it, which the parting haste he was in (or per∣haps some other reason best known to himself) confin'd him to give me. But in regard that I could not but think the Experiment would one way or other prove Extraordinary, I thought fit to take a Witness or two and an Assistant in the trying of it; and for that purpose made choice of an experi∣enced Doctor of Physick, very well vers'd in the separa∣ting and copelling of Metals. Though the Company (says Heliodorus) be so confident of your sincerity and wariness, that they would give cre∣dit even to unlikely Experiments, upon your single testi∣mony; yet we cannot but approve your discretion in taking an Assistant and a Witness, because in nice and uncommon Experiments we can scarce use too much circumspection, especially when we have not the means of reiterating the tryal: for in such new, as well as difficult cases, 'tis easie even for a clear-sighted Experimenter to over-look some important circumstance, that a far less skilful by-stander may take notice of. As I have ever judged, (saith Pyrophilus) that cautious∣ness is a very requisite qualification for him that would sa∣tisfactorily make curious Experiments; so I thought fit to imploy a more than ordinary measure of it, in making a tryal, whose event I imagined might prove odd enough. And therefore having several times observed that some men are prepossessed, by having a particular Expectation rais'd in them, and are inclined to think that they do see that hap∣pen which they think they should see happen; I resolved to obviate this prejudication as much as innocently I could, Page  9 and (without telling him any thing but the truth, to which Philosophy as well as Religion obliges us to be strictly loy∣al) I told him but thus much of the truth, that I expected that a small proportion of a Powder presented me by a Fo∣reign Virtuoso, would give a Brittleness to the most flexible and malleable of Metals, Gold it self. Which change I per∣ceiv'd he judged so considerable and unlikely to be effect∣ed, that he was greedy of seeing it severely try'd. Having thus prepared him not to look for all that I my self expected, I cautiously opened the Paper I lately men∣tioned, but was both surprized and troubled, (as he also was) to find in it so very little Powder, that in stead of two differing tryals that I designed to make with it, there seem'd very small hope left that it would serve for one, (and that but an imperfect one neither.) For there was so very little Powder, that we could scarce see the colour of it, (save that as far as I could judge it was of a darkish Red) and we thought it not only dangerous, but useless to attempt to weigh it, in regard we might easily lose it by putting it in∣to, and out of the Balance; and the Weights we had were not small enough for so despicable a quantity of matter, which in words I estimated at an eighth part of a Grain: but my Assistant, (whose conjecture I confess my thoughts inclin'd to prefer) would allow it to be at most but a tenth part of a Grain. Wherefore seeing the utmost we could rea∣sonably hope to do with so very little Powder, was to make one tryal with it, we weighed out in differing Balances two Drams of Gold that had been formerly English Coyn, and that I caused by one that I usually imploy to be cupell'd with a sufficient quantity of Lead, and quarted, as they speak, with refin'd Silver, and purg'd Aqua fortis, to be sure of the goodness of the Gold: these two Drams I put into a new Crucible, first carefully neal'd, and having brought them to fusion by the meer action of the fire, with∣out Page  10 the help of Borax, or any other Additament, (which course, though somewhat more laborious, than the most usual we took to obviate scruples) I put into the well-melted Metal with my own hand the little parcel of Pow∣der lately mentioned, and continuing the Vessel in the fire for about a quarter of an hour, that the Powder might have time to defuse it self every way into the Metal, we poured out the well-melted Gold into another Crucible that I had brought with me, and that had been gradually heated be∣fore, to prevent cracking. But though from the first fusion of the Metal, to the pouring out, it had turn'd in the Cru∣cible like ordinary Gold, save that once my Assistant told me he saw that for two or three moments it lookt almost like an Opale; yet I was somewhat surpriz'd to find when the matter was grown cold, that though it appear'd upon the Balance that we had not lost any thing of the weight we put in, yet in stead of fine Gold, we had a lump of Metal of a dirty colour, and as it were overcast with a thin coat, almost like half vitrified Litharge; and somewhat to in∣crease the wonder, we perceived that there stuck to one side of the Crucible a little Globule of Metal that lookt not at all yellowish, but like course Silver, and the bottom of the Crucible was overlaid with a vitrified substance, where∣of one part was of a transparent yellow, and the other of a deep brown, inclining to red; and in this vitrified substance I could plainly perceive sticking at least five or six little Globules that lookt more like impure Silver than pure Gold. In short, this stuff look so little like refin'd, or so much as ordinary, Gold, that though my Friend did much more than I marvel at this change, yet I confess I was surpriz'd at it my self. For though in some particulars it answered what I lookt for, yet in others, it was very differing from that which the Donor of the Powder had, as I thought, given me ground to expect. Whether the cause of my disap∣pointment Page  11 were that (as I formerly intimated) this Virtuoso's haste or design made him leave me in the dark; or whe∣ther it were that finding my self in want of sufficient dire∣ctions, I happily pitcht upon such a proportion of Mate∣rials, and way of operating, as were proper to make a new Discovery, which the excellent Giver of the Powder had not Design'd, or perhaps thought of. I shall not at all wonder, saith Cratippus, either at your Friends amazement, or at your surprize, if your further tryals did in any measure confirm what the superficial change that appeared in your Metal could not but incline you to conjecture. You will best judge of that (replies Pyrophilus) by the account I was going to give you of what we did with our odd Metal. And First, having rubb'd it upon a good Touchstone, whereon we had likewise rubb'd a piece of Coyn'd Silver, and a piece of Coyn'd Gold, we manifestly found that the mark left upon the Stone by our Mass be∣tween the marks of the two other Metals, was notoriously more like the Touch of the Silver than to that of the Gold. Next, having knockt our little lump with a Hammer, it was, (according to my prediction) found brittle, and flew into several pieces. Thirdly, (which is more) even the in∣sides of those pieces lookt of a base dirty colour, like that of Brass or worse, for the fragments had a far greater re∣semblance to Bell-Metal, than either to Gold or to Silver. To which we added this fourth, and more considerable, Ex∣amen; that having carefully weigh'd out one dram of our stuff, (reserving the rest for trials to be suggested by second thoughts) and put it upon an excellent now and well-neal'd Cupel, with about half a dozen times its weight of Lead, we found, somewhat to our wonder, that though it turn'd very well like good Gold, yet it continued in the fire above an hour and an half, (which was twice as long as we expected) and yet Page  12 almost to the very last the fumes copiously ascended, which sufficiently argu'd the operation to have been well carried on; and when at last it was quite ended, we found the Cupel very smooth and intire, but ting'd with a fine Pur∣plish Red, (which did somewhat surprize us) and besides, the refined Gold, there lay upon the cavity of the Cupel some dark-coloured recrements, which we concluded to have proceeded from the deteriorated Metal, not from the Lead. But when we came to put our Gold again into the Balance, we found it to weigh only about fifty three Grains, and consequently to have lost seven; which yet we found to be fully made up by that little quantity of recrements that I have lately mention'd, whose Weight and Fixity, compared with their unpromising Colour, did not a little puzzle us, especially because we had not enough either of Them, or of leisure, to examine their nature. To all which circumstan∣ces, I shall subjoin this, that to prevent any scruples that might arise touching the Gold we imploy'd, I caused a dram and a half that had been purposely reserv'd out of the same portion with that that had been debased; I caused this (I say) to be in my Assistants presence melted by it self, and found it (as I doubted not but I should do) fine and well-coloured Gold. I hope you will pardon my curiosity, saith Arristander to the Gentleman that spoke last, if I ask why you take no no∣tice of the effect of Aqua fortis upon your imbased Metal? Your Question, replies Pyrophilus, I confess to be very rea∣sonable, and I am somewhat troubled that I can answer it but by telling you that we had not at hand any Aqua fortis we durst relie on; which yet I was the less troubled at, be∣cause heretofore some tryals purposely made had inform'd me, that in some Metalline Mixtures the Gold if it were much predominant in quantity, may protect another Metal; (for in∣stance Silver) from being dissolved by that Menstruum, though not from being at all invaded by it. Page  13 There yet remain'd, saith Heliodorus, one examen more of your odd Metal, which would have satisfied me, at least as much as any of the rest, of its having been notably im∣bas'd: for if it were altered in its specifick gravity, that qua∣lity I have always observ'd (as I lately perceiv'd you also have done) to stick so close to Gold, that it could not by an additament so inconsiderable in point of bulk, be consi∣derably altered without a notable and almost Essential change in the texture of the Metal. To this pertinent discourse, Pyrophilus, with the respect due to a person that so worthily sustain'd the dignity he had of presiding in that choice company, made this return: I owe you, Sir, my humble thanks for calling upon me to give you an account I might have forgotten, and which is yet of so important a thing, that none of the other Phaenomena of our Experiment seem'd to me to deserve so much notice. Where∣fore I shall now inform you, that having provided my self of all the requisites to make Hydrostatical Tryals, (to which perhaps I am not altogether a stranger) I carefully weighed in water the ill-lookt Mass, (before it was divided for the coupelling of the above-mentioned dram) and found, to the great confirmation of my former wonder and conjectures, that in stead of weighing about nineteen times as much as a bulk of water, equal to it, its proportion to that liquor was but that of fifteen, and about two thirds to one: so that its specifick gravity was less by about 31/•…3 than if it had been pure Gold it would have been. At the recital of this notable circumstance, superadded to the rest, the generality of the Company, and the President too, by looking and smiling upon one another, express'd themselves to be as well delighted as surpriz'd; and after the murmuring occasion'd by the various whispers that pass'd amongst them, was a little over, Heliodorus address'd himself to Pyrophilus, and told him, I need not, and therefore shall Page  14 not, stay for an express order from the Company to give you their hearty thanks: for as the Obliging Stranger did very much gratifie you by the Present of his Wonderful Powder, so you have not a little gratified us by so candid and parti∣cular a Narrative of the effects of it; and I hope (continues he) that if you have not yet otherwise dispos'd of that part of your deteriorated Gold that you did not cupel, you will sometime or other favour us with a sight of it. I join in this request, said Crattippus, as soon as he per∣ceived the President had done speaking, and to facilitate the grant of it, I shall not scruple to tell Pyrophilus he may be confident that the Degradation of his Gold will not de∣preciate it amongst Us: since if it be allowable for Opinion to stamp such a value upon Old Coyns and Medals, that in the Judgment of good Antiquaries, a rusty piece of Brass or Copper, with a half defaced Image or Inscription on it, is to be highlier valued than as big a piece of well-stampt Gold; I see not why it should not be lawful for Philosophers to prize such a lump of depraved Gold as yours, before the finest Gold the Chymists or Mintmasters are wont to afford us. And though I freely grant that some old Copper Medals are of good use in History, to keep alive by their Inscriptions the memory of the taking of a Town, or the winning of a Battel; though these be but things that almost every day are some where or other done, yet I think Pyrophilus's imbas'd Metal is much to be preferr'd, as not only preserving the memory, but being an effect of such a Victory of Art over Nature, and the conquering of such generally believ'd in∣superable difficulties, as no Story that I know of gives us an example of. As soon as ever Crattippus had made a pawse, Pyrophilus to prevent complimental discourse, did in few words tell the President, That his part had been but that of a Relator of matter of Fact, and that therefore he could deserve but Page  15little thanks and no praise at all; though a good measure of both of them were due to the Obliging Virtuoso that had gi∣ven him the Powder; and in that, the opportunity of com∣plying with his duty, and his inclination, to serve that learn∣ed Company. These Gentlemen (saith Arristander) are not persons among whom modesty is either restrained from expressing it self, or construed according to the Letter; and there∣fore whatever you have been pleas'd to say, the Company cannot but think its self much obliged to you; and I know the obligation would be much increas'd, if you would favor us with your reflections upon the extraordinary Experiment you have been pleased to relate to us. If, replies Pyrophilus, I had had wherewithal to repeat the Experiment, and vary it according to the hints afforded me by the first tryal, I should be less unfit to comply with Arristander's motion: but the Phaenomena are too new and too difficult for me to attempt to unriddle them by the help of so slender an information as a person so little sagacious as I could get by a single tryal; and though I will not deny that I have had some •aving thoughts about this puzzling sub∣ject, yet I hope I shall easily be pardon'd, if I decline to pre∣sent crude and immature thoughts to a Company that so well deserves the most ripe ones, and can so skilfully disco∣ver those that are not so. I confess, saith Heliodorus, that I think Pyrophilus's wari∣ness deserves not only to be allow'd, but imitated; and there∣fore by my consent the further discourse of so abstruse a subject, shall be deferr'd till we shall have had time to con∣sider seriously of Phaenomena that will be sure to imploy our most speculative thoughts, and I fear to pose them too: only we must not forget that Pyrophilus himself ought to be not barely allow'd, but invited to draw before we rise, what Corrollaries he thinks fit to propose from what he hath al∣ready delivered. Page  16 The inference, saith Pyrophilus, I meant to make, will not detain you long; having for the main been already in∣timated in what you may remember I told you I design'd in the mention I was about to make of the now-recited Expe∣riment. For without launching into difficult Speculations, or making use of disputable Hypotheses, it seems evident enough from the matter of Fact faithfully laid before you, that an Operation very near, if not altogether as strange as that which is call'd Projection, and in the difficultest points much of the same nature with it, may safely be admitted. For our Experiment plainly shews that Gold, though confessedly the most homogeneous, and the least mutable of Metals, may be in a very short time (perhaps not amounting to many mi∣nutes) exceedingly chang'd, both as to malleableness, colour, homogeniety, and (which is more) specifick gravity; and all this by so very inconsiderable a proportion of injected Powder, that since the Gold that was wrought on weighed two of our English drams, and consequently an hundred and twenty grains, an easie computation will assure us that the Medicine did thus powerfully act, according to my estimate, (which was the modestest) upon near a thousand times, (for 'twas above nine hundred and fifty times) its weight of Gold, and according to my Assistants estimate, did (as they speak) go on upon twelve hundred; so that if it were fit to apply to this Anti-Elixir, (as I formerly ventur'd to call it) what is said of the true Elixir by divers of the Chymical Philoso∣phers, who will have the virtue of their Stone increas'd in such a proportion, as that at first 'twill transmute but ten times its weight; after the next rotation an hundred times, and after the next to that a thousand times, our Powder may in their language be stil'd a Medicine of the third order. The Computation, saith Arristander, is very obvious, but the change of so great a proportion of Metal is so wonderful and unexampled, that I hope we shall among other things Page  17 learn from it this lesson, That we ought not to be so forward as many men otherwise of great parts are wont to be, in pre∣scribing narrow limits to the power of Nature and Art, and in condemning and deriding all those that pretend to, or believe, uncommon things in Chymistry, as either (heats or Credulous. And therefore I hope, that though (at least in my opinion) it be very allowable to call Fables, Fables, and to detect and expose the Impostures or Deceits of ignorant or vain-glorious Pretenders to Chymical Mysteries, yet we shall not by too hasty and general censures of the sober and dili∣gent Indigators of the Arcana of Chymistry, blemish (as much as in us lies) that excellent Art it self, and thereby disoblige the genuine Sons of it, and divert those that are indeed Pos∣sessors of Noble Secrets, from vouchsafing to gratifie our Cu∣riosity, as we see that one of them did Pyrophilus's, with the sight at least, of some of their highly Instructive Rarities. I wholly approve, saith Heliodorus rising from his seat, the discreet and seasonable motion made by Arristander. And I presume, subjoins Pyrophilus, that it will not be the less lik'd, if I add, That I will allow the Company to be∣lieve that as extraordinary, as I perceive most of you think the Phaenomena of the lately recited Experiment; yet I have not (because I must not do it) as yet acquainted you with the Strangest effect of our Admirable Powder.

Page  [unnumbered]Page  [unnumbered]❧ The Pegme at Fen-church PResented it selfe in a square and flat vpright, like to the side of a Citty: the top therof, aboue the Vent, and Crest, adorn'd with houses, towres, and stee∣ples, set off in prospectiue. Vpon the Battlements in a great capitall Letters was inscribed, LONDINIVM: According to Tacitus: At Suetonius mir• constan∣tia, medios inter hosteis Londinium perrexit,* cognomen∣to quiàem Coloniae non insigne, sed copia Negotiatorum, & commeatu maxime celebre. Beneath that, in a lesse and different Character, was written CAMERA REGIA Which Title immediately after the Norman Con∣quest it beganne to haue;* and by the indulgence of succeeding Princes, hath beene hitherto conti∣nued. In the Freeze ouer the gate, it seemeth to speake this verse:  PAR DOMVS HAEC COELO, SED MINOR EST DOMINO.  Taken out of Martiall,* and implying, that though this Cittie (for the state, and magnificence) might (by Hyporbole) be saide to touch the starres, and reach vp to heauen, yet was it farre Inferior to the Maister thereof, who was his Maiestie; and in that respect vnworthy to receiue him. The highest per∣son aduaunc'd therein, was MONARCHIA BRITANNICAPage  [unnumbered] and fittely: applying to the aboue mentioned Title of the Citty, the Kings Chamber, and there∣fore heere placed as in the proper seate of the Em∣pire: for,* so the glorie and light of our King∣dome M. Camden, speaking of London, saieth, shee is, totius Britanniae Epitome, Britannicíque im∣perii sedes, Regúmque Angliae Camera, tantum inter •mneis eminet, quantum (vt ait ille) inter viburna Cu∣pressus. Shee was a woman richly attir'd in cloth of golde and tissue; a rich mantle; ouer her state twoo Crownes hanging, with pensile shieldes thorow them; the one lim'd with the particular Coate of England, the other of Scotland: on either side also a Crowne, with the like Scutchions, and peculiar Coats of France, & Ireland. In her hand she holdes a Scepter; on her head a fillet of gold, inter-wouen with Palme & Lawrel; her haire bound into foure seuerall points, descending from her Crownes; & and in her lappe a little Globe, inscrib'd vpon  ORBIS BRITANNICVS. And beneath, the word DIVISVS AB ORBE.  To shew, that this Empire is a world diuided from the world, and alluding to that of* Clau.* —Et nostro diducta Britannia mundo.  And Virg. —Et penitus toto diuisos orbe Britannos.*   The wreathe denotes Victory and Happines. The Scepter & Crowns soueraignty. The Shieldes the precedency of the Countries and their distincti∣ons. At her feete was set THEOSOPHIA,Page  [unnumbered] or Diuine wisdome, al in white, a blew mantle seeded with Stars, a crowne of Stars on hir head. Hir gar∣ments figur'd Truth, Innocence and Cleerenesse. She was alwayes looking vp; in her one hand shee sustained a Doue, in the other a Serpent:* the last to shew her Subtilty, the first her Simplicity; alluding to that text of Scripture,*Estote ergo prudentes sicut serpentes, & simplices sicut columbae. Her word, PER ME REGES REGNANT. Intimating, how by her, all Kings do gouerne, and that she is the foundation and strength of king∣domes, to which end, she was here placed, vpon a Cube, at the foote of the Monarchie, as her Base and stay.* Directly beneath her stoode GENIVS VRBIS. A person attir'd rich, reuerend, and antique: his haire long and white, crowned with a wreathe of Plane tree, which is saide to be Arbor genialis; his mantle of purple, and buskins of that colour: Hee held in one hand a Goblet, in the other a braunch full of little twigges, to signifie Increase and In∣dulgence: His word HIS ARMIS. pointing to the two that supported him, whereof the one on the right hand, was BOVLEVTES. Figuring the Councell of the Citty,* and was suted in blacke and purple; a wreathe of* Oake vppon his head; sustaining for his ensignes, on his left arme a scarlet roabe, and in his right hand the Page  [unnumbered]* Fasces, as tokens of Magistracie, with this inscrip∣tion; SERVARE CIVES. The other on the left hand. POLEMIVS The warrelike force of the City, in an antique Coate, or Armour, with a Target and Sword; his helme on, and crowned with Lawrell, implying Strength and Conquest: in his hand he bore the Standard of the Citty, with this word, EXTINGVERE ET HOSTEIS. Expressing by those seuerall Motts, connexed, that with those Armes of Councell and Strength, the Genius was able to extinguish the Kings ene∣mies, and preserue his Citizens, alluding to those verses in Seneca,* Extinguere hostem, maxima est virtus Ducis. Servare Cives, maior est patriae, patri.  Vnderneath these, in an Aback thrust out be∣fore the rest lay TAMESIS. The Riuer, as running along the side of the Ci∣ty; in a skinne made like flesh, naked, and blew. His mantle of sea-greene or water colour, thinne, and bolne out like a sayle; Bracelets about his wreasts, of willow and sedge, a crowne of sedge and reede vpon his head, mixt with water-lillies; alluding to Virgills description of Tiber;Page  [unnumbered] —Deus ipse loci,* fluvie Tyberinus amoeno, Populeas inter senior se att•llere frondes Visus. cum tenuis glauco velabat amictu Carbasus. & crineis vmbrosa tegebat Arundo.  His beard, and haire long, and ouergrowne. He leanes his arme vpon an earthen pot, out of which, water, with liue Fishes, are seene to runne forth, and play about him. His word, FLVMINA SENSERVNT IPSA. A Hemistich of Ouids:* The rest of the verse being, quid esset amor. Affirming, that Riuers themselues, and such inanimate Creatures, haue heeretofore beene made sensible of Passions, and Affections; and that hee, nowe, no lesse pertooke the ioy of his Maiesties gratefull approach to this Citty, than any of those persons, to whome he pointed, which were the daughters of the Genius, and sixe in num∣ber: who, in a spreading ascent, vpon seuerall gri∣ces, help to beautifie both the sides. The first, EVPHROSYNE, or Gladnes: was suted in greene, a mantle of diuers colors, embroydred with all varietie of floures: on her head a Gyrland of Myrtle, in her right hand a cristall Cruze filld with wine, in the left a Cup of golde: at her feete a Tymbrell, Harpe, and other Instruments, all ensignes of gladnesse,* Natis in vsum laetitiae scyphis, &c. And in another place, Nunc est bibendum,* nunc pede libero Pulsanda Tellus, &c.  Her word.* HAEC AEVI MIHI PRIMA DIES. Page  [unnumbered] As if this were the first houre of her life, and the minute wherein she beganne to be; beholding so long coueted, and look'd for a presence. The se∣cond. SEBASIS. or Veneratio, was varied in an ashe colour'd sute, and darke mantle, a vayle ouer her head of ash∣colour: her hands crost before her, and her eyes halfe closde: Her word: MIHI SEMPER DEVS.*  Implying both her office of reuerence, and the dignity of her obiect, who being as God on earth, should neuer be lesse in her thought: The third: PROTHYMIA. or Promptitude, was attir'd in a short tuckt garment of flame-colour, wings at her backe; her hayre bright, & bound vp with ribands; her breast open, virago-like; hir buskins so ribanded: She was crow∣ned with a Chaplet of Trifoly, to expresse readines, and opennesse euery way; in her right hand shee held a squirrell, as being the creature most full of life and quicknesse: in the left a close round Cen∣sor, with the perfume sodainely to be vented forth at the sides. Her word: QVA DATA PORTA.*  Taken from an other place in Virgill where Eo∣lus at the command of Iuno letts forth the winde;* —ac venti velut agmine facto Qua data p•rta ruunt, & terras turbine perflant.  And shew'd that shee was no lesse prepar'd with promptitude, and alacrity, then the windes were, Page  [unnumbered] vpon the least Gate that shall be opened to his high commaund. The fourth AGRYPNIA. or Vigilance, in yellow, a sable mantle, seeded with waking eies, and siluer fringe: her Chaplet of He∣liotropium, or Turnsole; in her one hand a Lampe, or Cresset, in her other a Bell. The Lampe signifi∣ed search and sight, the Bell warning. The Heliotro∣pium care; and respecting her obiect. Her word SPECVLAMVR IN OMNEIS. Alluding to that of Ouid, where he describes the office of Argus, —Ipse pr•cul mon•is sublime cacumen Occupat,* vnde sedens partes speculatur in omneis.  and implying the like duety of care and vigilance in her selfe. The fifth AGAPE. Or louing Affection, in Crimson fringed with golde, a mantle of flame-colour, her Chaplet of red and white roses; in her hand a flaming heart: The flame expressed zeale, the red and white ro∣ses, a mixture of Simplicity with Loue: her robes freshnes and feruency.* Her word, NON SIC EXCVBIAE. Out of Claudian, in following  —Nec circumstantia peila —Quàm tutatur amor.  Inferring, that though her Sister before had prote∣sted watchfulnes, & circumspection, yet no watch Page  [unnumbered] or guard could be so safe to the estate, or person of a Prince, as the loue and naturall affection of his Subiects: which she in the Citties behalfe promi∣sed. The sixt, OMOTHYMIA. Or Vnanimity in blew, her roabe blew, and bus∣kins. A Chaplet of blew lillies, shewing one trueth and intirenesse of minde. In her lappe lies a sheafe of arrowes bound together, and she her selfe sittes weauing certaine small siluer twists. Her word,  FIRMA CONSENSVS FACIT. Auxilia humilia firma,* &c.  Intimating, that euen the smallest and weakest aydes, by consent, are made strong: herselfe per∣sonating the vnanimity, or consent of Soule, in all inhabitants of the Citty to his seruice. ¶These are all the personages, or liue figures, whereof onely two were Speakers (Genius and Ta∣mesis) the rest were Mutes. Other dumbe com∣plements there were, as the Armes of the King∣dome on the one side, with this Inscription.  HIS VIREAS. With these maist thou flourish.  On the other side the Armes of the City, with  HIS VINCAS. With these maist thou conquer.  In the centre, or midst of the Pegme, there was an Aback, or Square, wherein this Elogie was writ∣ten.  Maximus hic Rex est, & lucc serenior ipsa Principe quae talem cernit in vrbe Ducem;  Page  [unnumbered] Cuiu• Fortunam superat sic vnica Virtus, Vnus vt is reliquos vincit vtrâque viros. Praeceptis alii populos, multâque fatigant Lege; sed exemplo nos rapit ille suo. Cuique frui totâ fas est vxore marito, Et sua fas simili pignora nosse pa•ri. Ecce vbi pignoribus circumstipata coruscis It comes, & tanto vix minor ANNA viro. Haud metus est, Regem posthac ne proximus Hares, Neu Successorem non amet ille suum.  This, and the whole frame, was couered with a curtaine of silke, painted like a thicke cloude, and at the approach of the K. was instantly to bee drawne. The Allegory being, that those cloudes were gathered vpon the face of the Citty, through their long want of his most wished fight: but now, as at the rising of the Sunne, all mistes were disper∣sed and fled. When sodainely vpon silence made to the Musikes, a voyce was heard to vtter this verse; Totus adest oculis,* aderat qui mentibus olim, Signifying that hee now was really obiected to their eyes, who before had beene only, but still, present in their mindes. ¶Thus farre the complementall parte of the first; wherein was not only labored the expression of State and Magnificence (as proper to a trium∣phall Arch) but the very Site, Fabricke, Strength, Policie, Dignitie and Affections of the Cittie were all laide downe to life: The nature, and pro∣pertie of these Deuises being, to present alwaies Page  [unnumbered] some one entire body, or figure, consisting of distinct members and eache of those expressing it selfe, in the owne actiue spheare, yet all, with that generall harmony so connexed, and disposed, as no one little parte can be missing to the illustration of the whole: where also is to be noted, that the Symboles vsed, are not, neither ought to be simply Hierogliphickes, Emblemes, or Imprese, but a mixed Character, pertaking somwhat of all, and peculier∣ly apted to these more magnificent Inuentions: wherein the Garments, and Ensignes deliuer the nature of the person, and the Word the present office. Neither was it becomming, or could it stand with the dignity of these shewes (after the most miserable & desperate shift of the Puppits) to require a Truch-man, or (with the ignorant Pain∣ter) one to write. This is a Dog; or, This is a Hare: but so to be presented, as vpon the view they might without cloude, or obscurity declare themselves to the sharpe and learned: And for the multitude, no doubt but their grounded iudgements gazed, said it was fine, and were satisfied.  The speeches of Gratulation.  GENIVS. TIme, Fate, and Fortune have at length conspir'd, To giue our Age the day so much desir'd. What all the minutes, houres, weekes, months, and yeares, That hang in file vpon these siluer haires, Could not produce, beneath thea Brittane stroke,  Page  [unnumbered] The Roman, Saxon, Dane, and Normana yoke, This point of Time hath done. Now London reare Thy forehead high, and on it striue to weare Thy choisest Gems; Teach thy steepe Towres to rise Higher with people: Set with sparkling eies Thy spacious windowes; and in euery streete, Let thronging Ioy, Loue, and Amazement meete. Cleaue all the ayre with show•es, and let the cry Strike through as long, and vniuersally As Thunder; For, thou now art blist to see That sight, for which thou didst beginne to bee. WhenbBrutus plough first gaue thee infant boūds, And I, thy GENIVS walk't auspicious rounds In eueryc furrow; Then did I forelooke, And saw this dayd mark't white ineClotho's booke. The seuerallf Circles, both of change and sway,  Page  [unnumbered] Within this Isle, there also figur'd lay: Of which the greatest, perfectest, and last Was this, whose present happinesse we taste. Why keep you silence Daughters? What dull peace Is this inhabites you? Shall Office cease Vpon th'aspect of him, to whom you owe More then you are, or can be? Shall TIME knowe That Article, wherein your flame stoode still, And not aspir'd? Now heauen auert an ill Of that blacke looke. Ere pause possesse your breasts I wish you more of plagues: ""Zeale when it rests, Leaues to be Zeale. Vp thou tame RIVER, wake; And from thy liquid limbes this slumber s•ake: Thou drown'st thy selfe in inofficious sleepe; And these thy sluggish waters seeme to creepe, Rather than flow. Vp, rise, and swell with pride Aboue thy bankes. ""Now is not euery Tyde.   TAMESIS. TO what vaine end should I contend to show My weaker powres, when Seas of pompe o'reflow The Citties face: and couer all the shore With sands more rich thanaTagus wealthy ore? When in the flood of Ioy, that comes with him, He drownes the world; yet makes it liue and swimme, And spring with gladnesse: Not my fishes heere, Though they be dumbe, but doe expresse the cheere Of these bright streames. No lesse mayb These, and I Boast our delights, albe't we silent lie.   Page  [unnumbered]GENIVS. INdeede, true Gladnesse doth not alwayes speake: Ioy bred, and borne but in the tongue, is weake.

And from this branch, may thousand branches more Shoote or'e the Maine, and knit with euery shore In •onds of Marriage, Kinred, and Increase;  Page  [unnumbered] And stile this Land, thea Nauill of their peace.

CArried the frontispice of a Tem∣ple, the Wals of which and Gates were Brasse; the Pillers Siluer, their Capitals and Bases Golde: in the highest point of all was e∣rected a Ianus head, and ouer it written. IANO QVADRIFRONTI SACRVM. Which title of Quadrifrons is said to be giuen him,* as he respecteth all Climates, and filles all parts of the world with his Maiestie; which Martiall would seeme to allude vnto in that Hendicasillable,*Et linguâ pariter locutus omni. Others haue thought it by reason of the foure Ele∣ments, which brake out of him, being Chaos: for Ouid is not afraide to make Chaos and Ianus the same, in those verses  Me Chaos antiqui (nam sum res prisca) vocabant:*  Adspice, &c. •• Page  [unnumbered] PLVTVS. or Wealth,* a little boy, bare headed, his locks curled, and spangled with golde, of a fresh aspect, his body almost naked, sauing some rich robe cast ouer him; in his armes a heape of gold Ingots to expresse ri∣ches, whereof he is the God: Beneath her feete lay ENYALIVS. or Mars, Groueling, his armour scattered vpon him in seuerall peeces, and sundrie sortes of weapons broken about him, her word to all was VNA TRIVMPHIS IN NVMERIS POTIOR. pax optima rerum Quas homini nouisse datum est,* pax vna Triumphis Innumeris potior.  signifieng that peace alone was better, and more to be coueted then innumerable Tryumphes, besides, vpon the right hand of her, but with some little descent, in a Hemicycle was seated ESYCHIA. or Quie•, the first handmaid of peace; A woman of a graue and venerable aspect, attired in black, vp∣on her head an artificiall nest, out of which ap∣peared Storkes heads to manifest a sweete repose. Her feete were placed vpon a Cube, to shewe sta∣bility, Page  [unnumbered] and in her lappe shee held a Perpendicular or leuell, as the ensigne of Euennesse and Rest; on the top of it sate a Halcion or Kings-fisher. She had lying at her feete TARACHE. or Tumult, in a garment of diuers, but darke coulers, her haire wilde, and disordered, a fowle and trou∣bled face, about her laye staues, swordes, ropes, chaines, hammers, stones, and such like to expresse Turmoile. The word was PERAGIT TRANQVILLA POTESTAS.*  Claud. Quod violent a nequit: mandat a{que} fortius vrget Imperiosa quies.

On the other, side the second hand∣maide, was ELEVTHERIA. or Libertie, her dressing white, & som-what antique but loose and free; her haire flowing downe her backe, and shoulders: In her right hand shee bare a Club, on her left a Hat, the Characters of freedom, and power: At her feete a Catt was placed, the creatrue most affecting, and expressing libertie. She trode on Page  [unnumbered] Rauen, as the Augury of ill fortune: & the Soule was REDEVNT SATVRNIA REGNA.

This is the dumbe argument of the frame, and illustrated with this verse of Virgil, writ∣ten in the vnder freeze.* NVLLA SALVS BELLO PACEM TE POSSIMVS OMNES.  The speaking parte was performed, as within the Temple where there was erected an Altar, to which at the approach of the K. appeares the Flamen * MARTIALIS. And to him. GENIVS VRBIS. The Genius we attired before: To the Flamen wee appoint this habit. A long Crimson robe to witnesse his nobility, his typpet and sl•eues white as reflec∣ting on purity in his religion, a rich mantle of gold with a traine to expresse the dignity of his function.

To which body (be∣ing framd before) we were to apt our soule. And finding that one of these seauen lights, Electra, is rarely or not at all to be seene, (as Ouid. lib. 4. Fast. affirmeth.

Where least the captious, or prophane might doubt, How these cleare heauenly bodyes come about All to be seene at once; yet neithers light Eclips'd, or shadow'd by the others sight:  Page  [unnumbered] Let Ignorance know, great King, this Day is thine, And doth admit no Night; but all do shine As well nocturnall, as diurnall fiers, To adde vnto the flame of our desiers.

Whose so faire And wholsome Lawes, in euery Court, shall striue By Aequity, and their first Innocence to thriue; The base and guiltie bribes of guiltier men Shall be throwne back, and Iustice looke, as when She lou'd the earth, and feard not to be sold For that,m which worketh all things to it, Gold. The Dam of other euils, Auarice Shall here lock downe her Iawes, and that rude vice Of ignorant, and pittied Greatnesse, Pride, Decline with shame; Ambition now shall hide Her face in dust, as dedicate to sleepe, That in great Portalls wont her watch to keepe.

Licet toto nunc Helicone frui.  Page  [unnumbered]Page  [unnumbered]A PANEGYRE. HEau'n now not striues, alone, our brests to fill With Ioyes: but vrgeth his full fauors still. Againe, the Glory of our Westerne world Vnfolds himselfe: and from his Eies are hoorl'd, (To day) a thousand radiant lights, that streame To euery nooke, and angle of his realme. His former raies, did only cleare the skie; But these his searching beames are cast, to prie Into those darke, and deepe concealed vaults, Where men commit black incest with their faults; And snore supinely in the stall of Sinne: Where Murder, Rapine, Lust, do sit within Carow•ing humane blood, in iron bowles, And make their Den the slaughter house of soules: From whose foule reeking cauernes first arise Those dampes, that so offend all good mens eies; And would (if not dispers'd) infect the Crowne, And in their vapor her bright Mettall drowne. To this so cleare, and sanctified an end, I saw, when reuerend TH•MIS did descend Vpon his state; let downe in that rich chaine, That fastneth heauenly power to earthly raigne: Beside her, stoup't on either hand, a Mayd, Faire DICE, and EVNOMIA; who were said To be her daughters: and but faintly knowne On Earth, till now, they came to grace his throne.  Page  [unnumbered] Her third, IRENE, help'd to beare his traine; And in her office vow'd shee would remaine, Till forraine Malice, or vnnaturall spight (Which Fates auert) should force her frō her right. With these he pas'd, and with his peoples hearts Breath'd in his way; and Soules (their better parts) Hasting to follow forth in shouts, and cries. Vpon his face all threw their couetous eyes, As on a Wonder; Some amazed stood, As if they felt, but had not knowne their good: Others would faine haue shew'n it in their words, But, when their speach so poore a helpe affords Vnto their zeales expression; They are mute: And only with red silence him salute. Some cry from tops of houses, thinking noise The fittest Herald to proclame true ioyes; Others on ground runnes gazing by his side, All, as vnwearied, as vnsatisfied: And euery Windore greiu'd it could not moue Along with him, and the same trouble proue. They, that had seene, but foure short daies before, His gladding looke, now long'd to see it more. And as of late, when he through London went, The amorous Citty spar'd no ornament, That might her beauties heighten; but so drest As our Ambitious Dames, when they make feast, And would be courted: so this Towne put on Her brightest tire; and in it aequall shone,  Page  [unnumbered] To her great Sist•r: saue that Modesty, Her Place, and Yeares gaue her precedency. The Ioy of either was alike, and full; No Age, nor Sexe so weake, or strongly dull, That did not beare a part in this concent Of Hearts, and Voices. All the Aire was rent, As with the murmure of a moouing wood; The ground beneath did seeme a mouing floud Walls, windores, roofes, towers, steeples, al were set With seuerall eyes, that in this obiect met. Old men were glad, their Fates till now did last; And Infants, that the howers had made such hast To bring them forth: Whilst riper ag'd, and apt To vnderstand the more, the more were rap't. This was the Peoples Loue, with which did striue The Nobles zeale, yet either kept aliue The others flame, as doth the Wike and Waxe That frendly temperd one pure Taper makes. Meane while, the reuerend Themis drawes aside The Kings obeying will, from taking pride In these vaine stirres, and to his mind suggests How he may triumph in his subiects brests, With better pompe. She tells him first, that Kings Are here on earth the most conspicuous Things: That they, by Heauen, are plac'd vpon his throne, To rule like Heauen; & haue no more, their owne, As they are Men, then Men. That all they doe Though hid at home, abroad is search'd into: Page  [unnumbered]〈1 page duplicate〉Page  [unnumbered]〈1 page duplicate〉   Page  [unnumbered] And, being once found out, discouer'd lies Vnto as many Enuies, there, as Eyes. That Princes, since they know it is their Fate, Oft-times, to haue the secrets of their state Betraid to Fame, should take more care, and feare In publique Acts what face and forme they beare. She then remembred to his thought, the Place Where he was going; and the vpward race Of Kings, praeceding him in that high Court; Their Lawes, their Endes; the Men she did report: and all so iustly, as his Eare was ioy'd To heare the Truth, from spight, or flattery voyd. She shewd him, who made wise, who honest Acts; Who both, who neither: all the cunning tracts, And thriuing statutes she could promptly note; The bloody, base, and barbarous she did quote; Where Lawes were made to serue the Tyran' will; Where sleeping they could saue, and waking kill; Where Acts gaue Licence to impetuous lust•  To bury Churches, in forgo•ten dust, And with their ruines raise the Pandars Bowers: When, publique Iustice borrow'd all her Powers From priuate Chambers; that could then create Lawes, Iudges, Consellors, yea Prince, and State. All this she told, and more, with bleeding Eyes; For Right is as compassionate as wise. Nor did he seeme their vices so to loue, As once defend, what THEMIS did reproue.  Page  [unnumbered] For though by Right, and b•nefite of Times,  He ownde their Crowns, he would not so their crimes. He knew that Princes, who had sold their Fame To their voluptuous lustes, had lost their Name; And that no wretch was more vnblest then he, Whose necessary good t'was now to be An euill King: And so must such be still, Who once haue got the habit to doe ill. One wickednesse another must defend; For Vice is safe, while she hath Vice to friend. He knew, that those, who would, with loue, command, Must with a tender (yet a stedfast) hand Sustayne the raynes, and in the checke forbeare To offer cause of Iniurie, or Feare. That Kings, by their example, more do sway Then by their Power; and men do more obay When they are lead, then when they are compell'd. In all these knowing Artes our Prince excell'd. And now the Dame had dried her dropping eyne, When, like an April Iris, flew her shine About the streetes, as it would force a spring From out the stones, to gratulate the King. She blest the People, that in shoales did swim To heare her speech; which still began in him And ceas'd in them. She told them, what a Fate Was gently falne from Heauen vpon this State; How deare a Father they did now enioy That came to saue, what Discord would destroy:  Page  [unnumbered] And entring with the power of a King, The Temp'rance of a priuate Man did bring. That wan affections, ere his steps wan ground; And was not hot, or couetous to be crown'd Before mens hearts had crown'd him. Who (vnlike Those greater bodies of the sky, that strike The lesser fiers dim) in his accesse Brighter then all, hath yet made no one lesse; Though many greater: and the most, the best. Wherein, his Choise was happie with the rest Of his great actions, first to see, and do What all mens wishes did aspire vnto. Hereat, the People could no longer hold Their bursting ioyes; but through the ayre was rol'd The length'ned showt, as when th' Artillery Of Heauen is discharg'd along the sky: And this Confession flew from euery voyce. Neuer had Land more reason to reioyce. Nor to her blisse, could ought now added bee, Saue, that she might the same perpetuall see: Which when Time, Nature, and the Fates deny'd, With a twice lowder showte aga•ne they cry'd. Yet, let blest Brittaine aske (without your wrong) Still to haue such a King, and this King long. Solus Rex, & Poëta non quotannis nascitur.

Page  [unnumbered]Page  1THe Inuention was, to haue a Satyre lodged in a little Spinet, by which her Maiestie, and the Prince were to come, who (at the report of certaine Cornets that were diuided in seuerall places of the Parke, to signifie her ap∣proach) aduanced his head aboue the toppe of the wood, wondering, and (with his Pipe in his hand) began as fol∣loweth.  SATIRE. HEre? there? and euery where? Some solemnities are neare, That these changes strike mine eare. My Pipe and I a part shall beare. And after a short straine with his Pipe; againe. Looke, see; (beshrew this Tree,) What may all this wonder be? Pipe it, who that list for me: I'le flie out abroade, and see. There hee leaped downe, and gazing the Queene and Prince in the face, went forward. That is Cyparissus face! And the Dame hath Syrinx grace! O that Pan were now in Place, Sure they are of heauenly race. Here he ranne into the wood againe, and hid himselfe Page  2 whilst to the sound of excellent soft Musique that was there conceald in the thicket; there came tripping vp the lawne, a Beuy of Faeries attending on Mab their Queene, who falling into an artificiall ring, that was there cut in the pathe, began to daunce a round, whilst their Mistresse spake as followeth.   FA•RIE.  Haile, and welcome worthiest Queene, Ioy had neuer perfect beene, To the Nimphes that haunt this Greene, Had they not this euening seene.   Now they Print it on the Ground With their feete in figures round, Markes that will be euer found, To remember this glad stound.   The Satyre peeping out of the bush, said. Trust her not you bonny-bell, Shee will forty leasinges tell, I doe know her pranks right well,  FA•RIE. Satyre, wee must haue a spell, For your tongue, it runnes to fleete.   SATYRE. Not so nimbly as your feete, When about the creame-boules sweete. You, and all your Elues do meete.  Page  3 Here hee came hopping forth, and mixing himselfe with the Faeries skipped in, out, and about their Circle, while the Elues made many offers to catch at him. This is Mab the mistresse-Faerie, That doth nightly rob the Dairie, And can hurt, or helpe the cherning, (As shee please) without discerning.  ELFE. Pug, you will anone take warning? Shee, that pinches countrey wenches, If they rub not cleane their benches, And with sharper Nailes remembers, When they rake not vp their Embers: But if so they chaunce to feast her In a shooe she drops a tester.   ELFE. Shall we strip the skipping Iester? This is shee, that empties Cradles, Takes out Children, puts in Ladles: Traines forth Midwiues in their slumber, With a siue the holes to number. And then leads them, from her Borroughs Home through Ponds, and water furrows.   ELFE. Shall not all this mocking stir vs? Shee can start our Franklins daughters, In their sleepe, with shrikes, and laughters, And on sweet Saint Anne's Night, Feed them with a promisd sight,  Page  4 Some of husbands, some of Louers, Which an empty dreame discouers.   ELFE.  Satyre, vengeance neere you houers, And in hope that you would come here Yester-eue the Lady*Summer,  She inuited to a Banpuet: But (in sooth) I con you thanke yet, That you could so well deceiue her Of the pride which gan vp-heaue her: And (by this) would so haue blowne her, As no wood-god should haue known her. Heere he skipped into the Wood.   ELFE. Mistres, this is onely spight: For you would not yester-night Kisse him in the Cock-shoutlight: And came againe,   SATIRE. By Pan, and thou hast hit it right.

He can neither bribe a grace,  Page  8 Nor encounter my Lords face With a pliant smile, and flatter, Though this lately were some matter To the making of a Courtier. Now he hopes he shall resort there, Safer, and with more allowance▪ Since a hand hath gouernance, That hath giuen those Customes chase, And hath brought his owne in place. O that now a wish could bring, The God-like person of a King, Then should euen Enuiefinde, Cause of wonder at the minde Of our Wood-man: But loe where His Kingly Image doth appeare, And is all this while neglected: Pardon (Lord) you are respected Deepe as is the Keepers hart, And as deere in euery part. See,* for instance where he sends His Sonne, his Heire; who humbly bends Lowe, as is his Fathers earth, To the wombe that gaue you birth: So he was directed first. Next to you, of whome the thirst Of seeing takes away the vse Of that part, should plead excuse For his boldnesse, which is lesse  Page  9 By his comlie shamfastnesse. Rise vp Sir, I will betray, All I thinke you haue to say; That your Father giues you here, (Freely as to him you were) To the seruice of this Prince: And with you these Instruments Of his wilde and Sy••an trade, Better not 〈◊〉 had.

At that, the whole Wood and place re•ounded with the noise of Cornets, Hornes, and other Hunting Mu∣sique, and a brace of 〈◊◊〉 p•t out; and as for∣tunately killd, as they were meant to be; euen in the sight of her Maiesti•. Page  10 This was the first Nights shew. Where the next day being Sunday, she rested, and on Monday, till after din∣uer; where there was a speach sodainly thought on, to in∣duce a Morrise of the Clownes there about, who most offi∣ciouslie presented themselues, but by reason of the throng of the Countrey that came in, their Speaker could not be hard, who was in the person of No-body, to deliuer this following speach and attired in a paire of Breeches which were made to come vp to his neck, with his armes out at his pockets, and a Cap drowning his face.  If my outside moue your Laughter, Pray Ioue, my inside be thereafter.   Queene, Prince, Duke, Earles, Countesses; you courtly Pearles: (And, I hope no mortall sinne, If I put lesse Ladyes in) Faire saluted bee you all. At this time it doth befall, We are the Huisher to a Morrise, (A kind of Masque) whereof good store is In the Countrey here about, But this, the choise of all the rout. Who because that no man sent them, Haue got No-body to present them. These are Things haue no suspicion Of their ill doing: nor Ambition,  Page  11 Of their well: but as the Pipe Shall inspire them, meane to skip. They come to see, and to bee seene, And though they dance afore the Queene, Ther's none of these doth hope to come by Wealth, to build another Holmby:  All those dauncing dayes are done, Men must now haue more then one Grace, to build their fortunes on, Else our soules would sure haue gone, All by this time to our feete. I not deny where Graces meete In a man, that quality Is a gracefull Property? But when dauncing is his best, (Beshrew me) I suspect the rest. But I am No-body, and my Breath (Soone as it is borne) hath death. Come on Clownes forsake your dumps, And bestir your Ho•naild stumps, Do your worst, Ile vndertake, Not a Ierke you haue shall make Any Lady here in Loue. Perhaps your Foole, or so, may moue Some Ladies woman with a Trick, And vpon it she may pick A paire of reuelling legs or two, Out of you with much a doe.  Page  12 But see the Hobby-horse is forgot. Foole it must bee your lot, To supplie his want with faces And some other Busson graces You know how; Piper playe, And let no body hence away.  There was also another parting speach, which was to haue been presented in the person of a youth, and accom∣pained with diuerse Gentlemens yonger sonnes of the Countrey, but by reason of the Multitudinous presse, was also hindred. And which wee haue here adioyned. ANd will you then Mirror of Queenes depart? Shall nothing stay you? not my Masters heart That pants to leese the comfort of your light, And see his Day e•e it be old grow Night? You are a Goddesse, and your will be done; Yet this our last hope is, that as the Sunne Cheares obiects far remou'd, as well as neare, So where soe're you shine, you'le sparkle here. And you deare Lord, on whome my couetous eye Doth feede it selfe but cannot satisfie, O shoote vp fast in spirit, as in yeares; That when vpon her head proud Europe weares Her stateliest tire, you may appeare thereon The richest Gem without a paragon. Shine bright and fixed as the Artic•• starre:  Page  13 And when flow Time hath made you fit for war, Looke ouer the strict Ocean, and thinke where You may but leade vs forth, that grow vp here Against a day, when our officious swords Shall speake our action better then our words. Till then, all good euent conspire to crowne Your Parents hopes, our zeale, and your renowne. Peace, vsher now your steps, and where you come, Be Enuie still stroke blind, and Flattery dumbe. Thus much (which was the least of the Entert•i•ement in respect of the reality, abondance, delicacie, and order of all things else) to doe that seruiceable right, to his noble Friend, which his affection owes, and his Lordships merit may challenge, the Author hath sufferd to come out, and encounter Censure: and not here vnnecessarily adioyned, being performed to the same Queene & Prince; who were no little part of these more labord and •riumphall shewes. And to whose greatest part, he knowes the Ho. L. (had he beene so blest as to haue seene him at his Lodge) would haue stretcht in obseruance, though he could not in Loue or zeale.  FINIS. "

Worthy Gentlemen: IF in this brief Argument (which here treats of your Charters, and maintains your priviledges) there be any thing beseem∣ing an Advocate of yours: I desire the intire advantage thereof may redound solely to your selves. For indeed the Merit of your Cause is such, as would require an able Orator: and when I first applyed my self to serve you herein, I perceived your inter∣est was the same as the Common interest of all Merchants, and that could have no termination, but in the common interest of our Nation: But if there appear any Error, or Fayler in these papers: if the workmanship be found too unworthy of the stuffe: I shall then desire of all my Readers, that the blame may be onely mine: and that none but my self may suffer the least disadvantage by my defects, and disabilities. I am certain all wise, impar∣tial Judges will distinguish betwixt that which is mine in this weak peece, and that which is yours: and if they cast some disdain upon me for not Page  [unnumbered] pleading your cause, as I might: they will not proceed to a condemnation of your cause, for being no better pleaded here then it is. In Queen Elizabeths dayes a Tract to this very purpose was Printed by Mr. Wheeler (a learned Gent: that preceded me in this place) were that Tract now re-printed, perhaps our Times would be better satisfied in this Case. It came not to my fight, till after I had formed the lump of this, and given it all those rude lineaments almost, which it now bears: and I was induced then to persist in my resolution of finishing this, and not of retroce∣ding; the rather; because I saw my stile and method varied much from his: because, the face of the times (which has great influence upon the State and fate of Merchandize) was not the same when He wrote, as it is now:, because, his Tract was in bulk more then twice, as great as mine; because, He might give some light to me in some things, and I adde some to Him in other things; and so both might be more effectuall for the ends proposed by both, then either: because, if He was more satisfactory in matters of this particular Company, I had some thoughts in my self, that I was more proper for the affairs of Merchants in generall. These reasons kept from abortion this Essay of mine at that time: but for how long a space it was repreived, I cannot prognosticate: nor do I much regard how soon its fatall houre ap∣proaches, so the businesse which it aymed at may survive, and prosper. Gen∣tlemen, my reputation in this case must run some hazard, and stand or fall, as the vogue of this age pleases: yet my intention is to be judged of onely by you; wherefore let that onely finde your fair acceptation, and favourable construction, and that shall be a sufficient encouragement to  Hamb: Decemb. 30. 1647. Your Worships obliged, faithfull Servant, HEN: PARKER.   Page  1A DISCOURSE CONCERNING FREEDOM OF TRADE. MAN is taught by the rules of Wisdom to begin at the End of his Actions, and to give the first place in his intention, to that which is to have the last in Execu∣tion. Now the end of this discourse is improvement of Trade; and it being a thing of late much controverted by di∣vers; whether Freedome in Trading be a proper means, or no, to improve Trade: These two Termes (Freedome and Trade) must be the subject matter of this Discourse. As for Trade the word is plain, and needs no explanation: and the thing is as obvious to every mans understanding, and so needs no definition. I will therefore premise something very briefly concerning the value, and importance of Trade, that my end here aymed at, to which my intention must needs give the precedence, may not seem in∣considerable to any: and then cursorily from my first Terme, I shall addresse my self to my second. My Lord Cook in his Commentary upon our Great Charter (where the Merchants contentment is so prudently provided for) tels us, that Traffick is the Merchants livelihood, and that the livelihood of the Merchant is the life of the Common-weal, such as the King himself, and every Subject of the Land has an interest in. He observes also that the Merchant is the good Bay∣liffe of the Realme, aswell to export Native, as to import forrain Commodities for the benefit and necessary defence of the same. This Politick Argonante in Law amongst matters of Law, thinks it no extravagance to deliver his judgement of matters in Trade; and if we rightly analyse his judgement herein, we shall finde, Page  2 that not a word of it falls to the earth without its due weight. The Merchant indeed has a great dependance upon him both of Land and Water men, and is often commander of great summes of ready mony (greater then other men commonly though better landed, and estated can raise upon suddaine, pub∣lick exigences) and so even in his gowne at home he is a proffit∣able member of the Commonwealth: but look upon him in his imployment serving the State by his traffick, and so he is more then profitable, He is necessary to the well beeing, nay to the beeing of the State. Those things which he exports conduce perhaps more to profi•, and things imported to securance: yet tis well intimated here that both exportation, and importation do conduce to both. Native Commodities more immediatly afford us Treasure: yet Treasure is as well firmamentum belli, as ornamentum pacis: and forrain commodities more usually are ma∣terialls for Shipping, Armes, supplyes in times of dearth, and distresse, &c. yet somtimes we retayle the same to strangers for gaine, and thereby convert them into ornaments of peace, as well as instruments of defence. How prodigiously did Antwerpe formerly in a very few yeares aggrandize it selfe? and what an excesse of splendor has Amsterdam attaynd to since? yet (for ought I know) Nature has bestowde no more previledge upon those two Townes whereby to advance themselves with such facility: then it has upon Bristoll, & Newcastle amongst us. Sure then, the Hollander and Fleming may infuse this secret into us from that wonderous degree of opulence, and pompe, which both by Trade have ascended unto▪ that importation of exotick commodities, if subtilly managed, may become as great an im∣provement, as exportation is to other• It is visible in the Hol∣lander that the mines of Perne are as serviceable to Him, as to the poore Iudian, that diggs in them that the F••…rs of Russiia are e∣qually parted betwixt Him and the Muscovite: that the plaines of Cots-would, and Lemster do as well graze his sheepe, as they do the Englishman▪ And there was a time when the Antwer∣pian might have boasted as truly, that Arabia was his g•rdine, that Spayne was his Orchard, that Norway was his Forrest. That City (tis true) which abounds with commodities of its own, has an easier, & shorter way to prosperity then that City which Page  3 is de••itate of the like helps, and opportunities, and yet experi∣ence discovers daily to us, that some Cities which have little of their own, being industrious, slowe with more abundance, and swim in greater supefluity; then some other sloathfull Cities, that naturally want nothing. Hence is the difference betwixt the Merchant and the Husbandman, the Husbandmans thrift is in vendendo, not emendo as old Cato tells him: But the Merchant has found out a way, how he may be emax, and vendax in the same thing, and often times the retaylor findes the second sale more beneficiall to Him, then the first was to the Proprietor. Nay even the more unusefull Crawmarys of N•rinburgh though they argue no thrift in them, that buy them at last hand, yet they also are no contemptible mines of Gold and silver to those which make, or buy them for a second utterance. Furthermore, if from Merchandize it selfe, and these good Bayliffes of the Realme, which so actively purvey in all parts of the world habi∣table, and uninhabitable for Treasure, armes, and all other things, that partain to pleasure, health, and necessity: if from them, we turn to the instruments, of their negotiations our Ships, the wooden walls, and fortification of our State, of what re∣spect ought these to be? Even these (under God) in times of Peace prevent War: in times of War procure Peace: in times of plenty they releive our Friends abroad, in times of dearth they releive us at home. For examples, tis losse of time to offer any in this argument, every man can tell how stupendiously Tyre, Sydon, &c. of old, and Ʋenice, Belgia and other latter Signioryes have flourisht since by the gaines of Merchandize, whilst their puissance, and magnificence has been more raised, and propaga∣ted by the Merchant, then either by the Husbandman, souldier, or Scholler. Tis admirable to see what vast revenues are pur∣chast by some Nations (especially where Democracy takes place) out of meere commerce; and how far other Nations in the mean time (especially such as are swayde by Monarchs) though more commodiously situated, and advantagiously qualified o∣therwise do neglect the same. The reason hereof may be, be∣cause in popular States the Merchant usually has more share in administration of publick affaires: whereas in Monarchies, those that have the charge of the rudder, have commonly little Page  4 insight into Trade, and as little regard of Traders. Howsoever either some singular happinesse has hitherto attended Spaine, and Portugal, or else doubtlesse the feats of Merchandice have been in more then ordinary esteeme with their Kings: for both these have not onely inriched their own homes by Sea adventures, but also acquired thereby greater Dominions then their own. For indeed besides those purchases which have been made in the East Indies, we see in Mexico, and Peru, there is a new Hemisphere ad∣joyned now to that old half world, which the Assyrians, Persians, Grecians, Romans with so much sweat, and blood laboured to subjugate heretofore. And if the Sun find no degree in all his circuit, where He can obscure himself from the Crown of Spaines Subjects; the thanks thereof is due to the Art of an old Naviga∣tor: and probably had Hen: 7. given as much credit to Columbus as Ferdinand did, either the Austrian Family had not spread its wings so wide, or the Kings of England had not been so closely intrenched within the foure British Seas, as now they are. But I purposely wave the ostentation of many, and great instances, and therefore the whole weight of this Argument shall onely be hung upon the single epitome (as it were) of this pety jurisdicti∣on here, wherein we now reside. All the Land-intradoes, which tillage or pasturage yeelds to this Town of Hamburgh are not much more considerable then some Gentlemen and Esquires inherit in England; yet the wilde Ocean, as these restlesse Copemen plow it with their Fleetes, and harrow it with their nets; (though they creep into that too through a River, not wholly at their command) is forced to pay them as great a Tribute, and ample a rent as three the richest and goodliest Counties of England are annually worth. Never∣thelesse England more abounding with all habiliments, and ne∣cessary accommodations of Trade, and seeming to be as much courted by the circumambient Sea, as any part of the Universe, for want of incouragement to her Merchants at home, and Plan∣tators abroad owes little of her grandour, and power to that Element. Forrein Nations easily become greater gainers by tra∣ding into England, then the English can by trading abroad: 'tis too probable, that forrein Merchants reserve an intire gain to themselves out of all their own▪ Commodities brought in hither: Page  5 yet share a half profit with us, in all our Commodities exported hence by them. And thus whilest we leave many benefits to our emulous hostile neighbours, which by the same industry (as they commendably use) might by us be anticipated to our own be∣hoof; our own supine sluggishnesse is the cause that we remain so much the weaker, and our Enemies become so much the stronger. Thus much of the advantages of traffick; thus much of the necessity of that noble profession, which teaches us to be the curious, & laborious marriners of all the worlds Oceans, Straits, and Creeks; if we have any desire to be more formidable to our Enemies, or more aidfull to our Friends, or more gainfull to our selves, this may be held sufficient. From the benefit, I come now to the Freedom of Trade: I mean, that particular degree of freedom, which is at this day pleaded for, and patroniz'd by some, that professe themselves no un∣friends to Trade. Herein this method shall conduct me: In the first place, I shall inquire, whether that Freedom, which is affect∣ed by these times can stand with due order, and discipline, or not: secondly, whether Trade probably can flourish, or not, without due order and discipline: and in the last place, I shall answer such Arguments, as are framed for liberty, and do militate against our Order and Discipline. Liberty in a right acception, and understanding, is that which delivers, and exempts us from some evill noxious, and offensive to us; such as is oppression, too much restraint, &c. but it includes not any wilde condition, such as leaves us loosly in all things to our own discretion. That famous Roman, that had the happines to set Greece (in that age the Eye of the world) at liberty, and did break in sunder the yoke of Macedon, when He saw in the people too much wantonnesse, and immoderation, He advised them to more continencie, and to retire into narrower bounds; Vt saltem meram libertatem non haurirent. Herein he seemed wisely to distinguish betwixt that sheere, unmixt freedom, which uses to intoxicate us, and to bring detriment, and danger with it; and that allayed, or mixt freedom, which God, and Nature have made so sweet to all Generous mindes: whose property it is ever, to set restraints to it self in some things, as well as to take re∣straints Page  6 off from us in other. In politicks, there are Free Mo∣narchs, and there are Free Subjects: and the freedom of Mo∣narchs is not incompatible with the freedom of Subjects: for nei∣ther is it necessary to the freedom of a Prince, that He should be unlimitable in all things, and beyond controll as well when He destroys, as when He saves: nor to the freedome of a Subject to live absolved from all Laws, and obedience. Without all questi∣on, He is the freest Prince that has the most power to do good, and the least to do harm: and He is the freest Subject, who is to pay his obedience to the mildest Laws, and indulgentest Magi∣strates. So in Ethicks: He injoyes the purest and most refined free∣dome in his own breast, which has the least furious passion to serve, and the least impetuous appetite to master; not He that is becalmed, as it were, and finds no mobility at all in his spirit. The variovs Luminaries in Heaven have their distinct magni∣tudes, motions, and stations: and the blessed Intelligences in the Heaven of heavens (nay even those spirits that are falne from blessednesse) retain severall distances of power, place, and office. All these things prove to us, that restraint, and liberty, are rela∣tive things, and not to be accounted simply good, or simply bad in themselves. When restraint deprives us of that good which is in temperate liberty it degenerates into oppression: when it onely saves to us that good, which is in harmonious order, it is fully answerable to Liberty. So liberty when it onely discharges us from that evill, which is in oppression, it approaches to the perfection of Order: but when it dissolves all Order, it precipi∣tates us headlong into confusion. Liberty is either intensive, or extensive, and both wayes it must be reduced to a just standart: for if it be in degree too void of temperature, and qualification the ruder sediment of the people cannot bear it, it strangely inebriates them: and if the degree of it be moderate, yet the dilatation of it to too many makes it in∣commodious. There are two vitious extreames in government; the one is rigorous, and makes nothing lawfull, or safe to any: the other is remisse, and leaves all things free and safe to all: now by the consent of all; that extreame, which straitens too much, is not so desperately ill, as that which inlarges too much. The reason is, because those which govern are fewer in number then Page  7 the governed: and therefore clashing, and confusion (which must needs inevitably follow, where all limits, and restraints are taken away) is lesse dammageable amongst a few, then it would be amongst many. Liberty therefore may well be compared to fresh waters, it is potable, and sweet whilst it endures a just confinement in the vaines and channells of the earth. But when it once refundes it selfe into the bosome of the briny Ocean, it retaynes no longer its former relli•h. And even so we must censure of Liberty by the last, whilest it produces good effects it remains Liberty, the name and thing agree well: but when it supplyes to us no good at all, or bereaves us of some good greater then it supplyes, it remaines no more then the shadow, or meere misnomer of Liber∣ty. Exempli gratiâ: If all Land-inclosures were every where layde open, and all evidences cancelled, upon which mens pri∣vate interests, and proprieties depend, many poore men would expect to have their conditions meliorated; yet undoubtedly their expectations at last would faile them; and together with community in all things a generall confusion of all persons, and things would breake in to the fatall destruction both of poore and rich. Our common Proverbe puts us rightly in mind, that he which dwells every where, dwells no where: that every mans interest is no mans intrest, & that every mans businesse is no mans busines: now this being true in matters of Husbandry, and in all other in∣terests, and negotiations, why should it not be as true in matters of commerce, for if agriculture generally be more necessary then trade: and if confusion in agriculture be more mischeivous then confusion in Trade, yet by the same consequence confusion in trade? is as mischievous to Traders, as confusion in tillage would be amongst those that till the earth. Thus much of the word Freedome generally taken, I must now speake more particularly of that Freedome, whose expedience, or inexpedience is so much question'd in the busines of Trade. Freedome and restraint are things opposite (we see) yet both admitting of severall degrees, and limitations, they are not so opposite but that some kinde of restraint may be reconciled to some kinde of freedome, for in as much as it is sometimes conve∣nient Page  8 to be restrained, though not alwaies, and from all things; and sometimes it is inconvenient to be loosed, or inlarged though not alwaies, and from all things: in regard that re∣straint at sometimes onely upholds Order, and liberty at other times introduces confusion: Our mayne Quaere, is onely this; Whether that restraint in Trade which hitherto has been esta∣blish't amongst such and such Companies of Merchants, be con∣ducing to Order, or no: And whether that Freedome of Trade which irregular Interlopers dispute for be the usher of confusion, or no. For the just discussion of this, the benefit of Order, regulation, and approved discipline amongst Merchants, is to be considered and brought into the scole of this hand, whilst the advantage of opennes, loosenesse, and unconfinednesse in trading is to be brought into the other. For out of all question, liberty is not to be poized by the meer sound of its name, but by the solid priviledges which it brings with it, & in like manner restraint is not to be rejected except one ly for the certaine, substantiall disadvantages which are found to accompany it. Let us then draw up an exact ballance. The 1. Benefit which we now injoy by our government, and incorporation is in things appertaining to Gods worship, & the true Religion: though we live amongst Lutherans, Papists, Jews, Mahometans, Pagans: Yet we have a free exercise of our Religi∣on, and in some places the Ordinances are as duly, profitably, and comfortably administerd amongst us, as if we were in the besome of our own Church. How much this priviledge tends to the honor of God, the pro∣pagation of the true faith, how much to the prosperity of trade (Godlinesse having not onely the promises of the world to come, but also of this life) & how much to be bewail'd the want of the Word, and Sacraments is amongst our Merchants in Spaine, Italy, Portugal; let all men judge. Yet how this divine blessing can be continued amongst us, after that we are bound together by no links of Association, but that we may trade at large arbitrarily where we list, how we list, and when we list, is worthy to be considered; and I beleive all men who have a true sence, and tincture of Religion in their hearts will consider it Page  9 seriously. The next benefit is in matters of Justice: Though we are far distant from our own Judges & Courts, and cannot have timely recourse to the remedie of our owne Laws, nay though we should otherwise be exposed to the snares, and rigors of forrein Laws, and Magistrates, we are now (in matters where appeale is not requisite) tryed by men of our own Religion, of our own Nation, and education, and such also as are present up∣on the place. All Partners that enter into a joynt Trade for the most part Covenant here mutually, and voluntarily in all cases of dispute, and doubt to stand to the judgment of this Court, I never saw any Indentures hitherto without that expresse clause in them. Nay even strangers here have often declined their owne Tribu∣nals, and submitted their cases to our decisions, and I never yet heard of any of them that departed not from our Court ful∣ly satisfied both with our Justice, and expedition: it cannot there∣fore be expected, that our own Merchants which know so well what a priviledge it is to be judged by Merchants, especially be∣ing present upon the place, and such as guide their judgments by the same Merchants Law, as is in force in England, should not set a great price upon this especiall priviledge. Hen: the 4th. and Hen: the 7th. were as wise Kings as ever raign'd in England, and when the one of them granted our Charter, & the other inlarged the same, the main consideration, which both of them had in their eyes, was the prevention of many mischeifs empeachments, & obstructions which at that time sensibly oppressed Merchants, and confounded Trade, ob defectum boni, & sani Regiminis. A Third Benefit which we are now capable of by being incor∣porated into Companies is, that hereby we are inabled to do many egregious works of charity, which by our disfranchise∣ment would all be utterly lost, and extinguisht. The Merchant Adventurers are but one branch of the Mer∣chants of England, and the Merchants here residing are but one branch of the Merchants Adventurers, yet how many hundreds has this branch sustained, and releived in cases of necessity? and how many widowes, and poore families doth it constantly feed and refresh? About 16 yeers since, when the expedition of Mar∣quise Halmilton had miscarried here in Germany many, sick, di∣stressed souldiers that were the wofull splinters of his broken ar∣army Page  10 came hither, and were not onely saved from perishing, but also shipt for England at this Companies charge. M: Ant: Beding-field was then our Deacon, and had the charge of the poores box, he is now a Parliament man, and can averre upon his knowledge that this society issued no lesse at that time within 6 months space then 400 pound, for such devout purposes. A Fourth Benefit afforded by our present Governments, is, that hereby we are render'd far more considerable instruments to serve and honour our own Country, then else we should be, and that not onely in Trade, but also in diverse other eminent, publick Offices. As we are now imbodied, and compacted, we can by our com∣mon seales raise great summes of mony: We are in a qualifica∣tion to entertaine Princes, to oblige Cities, to procure right, and timely intelligence, and sometimes to prevent publick misunder∣standings: and so to merit much oftentimes of the Nation, from whence we are. That formidable Armado which in 1588 was designed to swal∣low us up, had inprobability been far more fatall then it was if it had been appointed sooner, and arrived when Queen Eliza∣beth was not so well appointed as it found her afterwards. And yet this is well known, that Gr•sham and other Merchants by taking up the monys at Genoa, and our Company by doing the like at Keeler Mart in Holsteine: did so prevent Philip that his Invasion was retarded thereby for a whole year, and that retard∣ment being so much to the disadvantage of Spaine, and to the ad∣vantage of England, was under God a powerfull meanes of pre∣serving us. Charles the 5th. by calculation found that in Ant∣werpe 20000 Soules, and in all the Low Countries at least 60000 had a lively-hood, and subsistance from the English Trade: where∣fore when he was very resolute to bring the inquisition into Ant∣werpe, and remained unmoovable against all other arguments, and supplications of that Town: yet this motive, that the Eng∣l•sh Company would be dislodged by introducing of that ri∣gor, diverted him from his purpose. Also when the same Charles had transferred all his signiories, & Dominions to his son Philip, that branch of the Merchant Ad∣ventures appeared in gallant state to grace those Solemnities, Page  11 consuming above 2000 Crowns in sumptuous furniture, shewes and triumphall arches. In the yeer 1581. likewise the Duke of Alanson in the same City was entertained by 80 English Merchants of the same Company, all bravely mounted on horse back, apparelled in black velvet, & most of them with brooches & chains of gold about their necks: for which they received thanks from Queen Elizabeth and the Lords of her Councell. The King of Bohemia, and some of our Kings Nephews (besides di∣verse Embassadors) have found some seemly receptions also from us here at Hamburgh, and from our brethren at Roterdam, upon severall occasions, but I forbeare prolixity in this point. An other excellent singular Benefit of our government is, that thereby we are put into a capacity of injoying all that is good and profitable in union, and all that is good, and profitable in division withall. Take away that Order, and Harmony that is now setled amongst us, and has been setled by all our Kings, and countenanced by all our Parliaments from Hen: the 4th. till this very day, and as fully confirmed by this Parliament as by any: and our Trade will become instantly both stragling, and con∣fused: and as a stragling Trade will deprive us of whatsoever is good in union, so a confused Trade will abridge us of all that is good in a due method, and distribution. This may be demonstrated most plainly in a military bodie: 20000 men well armed, and imbattaild, are of greater force, then 40000 drawn together in an unformed, undigested heap; and when that shall be accounted an Army of so many Souldiers ef∣fective, this shall be despised as a rout of so many men rudely conglomerated, and thronged together. For 'tis not sufficient that there be together in one Feild a due proportion of Com∣manders and Souldiers, of Horse and Foot, of Arms offensive, and defensive: all these must be severally ranged, and distantly im∣ployed: the Commander must move here, the Souldier there, the Horse must charge here, the Foot there; such a Regiment must be assigned its post here, such a Brigade must advance there: wise men know experimentally, that there is an art in division some∣times, such as in many cases gives life to Union: and it is as true on the contrary: that the queintest division makes miserable Mu∣sick, when it is not subservient to Union. For let a Battail be Page  12 marshall'd in all its members, and parts according to the most exact rules of souldery either ancient, or moderne: yet if the Trumpets sound contrary points of warre, if the superior Com∣manders give contrary Orders, if all these curiously fashion'd digestions, and divisions be not inspirited with one, joynt designe, which like the soul is to over-rule all the Organs, what can be expected from this great, moliminous frame? Now if we make any doubt whether or no the use of Tacticks be as great in mer∣catorian, as in military affairs let us come to neerer application, and bend our selves to consider, as well what the want of union, as what the want of distribution usually occasions amongst Traders. Union amongst Merchants cannot be denyed to be of exceed∣ing great importance, for in all places where we six our residence, we see, it makes as more valuable, and acceptable: Whilest we are lookt upon as an orderly, united Society, we are known to be able to make, or divert a Trade in or from any one Town, or Province. How soon was Bruges in Flanders despoyl'd of its fame, and opulence after our Company withdrew from it? and how soon did Antwerpe transcend Bruges in fame, and opulence after our Commodities were stapled in Brabant? When 'twas too late, Bruges, besides inlargement of former priviledges, could offer us moneys, and descend to strange intreaties for the wooing and winning of our return: but Antwerpe had first prevailed with us, and having prevailed, it sent forth its Magistrates to meet, and welcome us with processions. And well it was for Antwerpe, that the English were so taken with their civilities, for in the space of 60 or 70 yeers, whereas it had, before it was our Mart, not above foure able Merchants, and six Ships, it became the glorious Ma∣gazine of all Europe. The like instance might be given in Stodt, and Hamburgh, the same cause that now makes Hamburgh rich, did once do the like at Stodt: and the same cause that made Stodt poore, may hereafter perhaps work the same effect in Hamburgh. Who sees not therefore that from the benefit which strangers re∣ceive from us, whilest we are thus associated, and made capable of marrying our Company to them, arise those reciprocall obli∣gations, and speciall dowries, as it were, which they by their concordates confirm unto us? Where we are unprofitable, we must Page  13 expect to be held despicable: and what extraordinary profit can other Nations expect from our Merchants, when they appear onely as so many individuall persons, or stragling Traders. The English had at the Narre in Leisland a good Trade, and good sales for our Native Commodities for a while, but about 1565. divers stragling Merchants resorted thither out of England and so brought themselves, and their wares into great contempt. Divers of them went about the Town with Cloth in their arms, and Measures in their hands, and so when they had shamefully imbased our English Draperies, to the disreputation of our Coun∣trey, and decay of themselves, the Lords of the Councell at the next Parliament were inforced, for prevention of the like sordid, Pedlar-like traffick thereafter, to comprise the Narre within the Muscovie Companies Charter. Thus is Union, or a politick Association amongst Merchants, beneficiall to the places where we trade, and by resultance bene∣ficiall to our selves, and in the last resort beneficiall to our whole Nation: for all these interests are so interweaved, that the benefit of the Stranger is requited with the benefit of the English Mer∣chant; and the benefit of the English Merchant is to be regarded as the benefit of the English Nation. For in some things that which immediately advantages the English Merchant, advanta∣ges mediately the English Nation: even as in other things that which immediately brings prosperity to the English Nation, me∣diately brings prosperity to the English Merchant. This is to il∣lustrate the Commodities which flowe from our Union, now the Commodities which flowe from a due distribution, and division in Trade are no lesse visible. The whole world almost is now apt∣ly cantoniz'd amongst several Societies of our Merchants, whilest some trade East, some West, some neerer, some further off; and were it not for this apt partition, it would unavoidably fall out, that some Mart Towns would prove over-pester'd, or like a Com∣mon of Pasture over-layd, whilest others in the mean time would be left utterly unfrequented. And sure if the world were not spa∣cious enough for a •our Traders, some pretence might be fra∣med, why all men ought to be licenced in all places: but since the contrary is most true, and no man is so straited for want of roome, but that He may trade in some places to his own advan∣tage, though he be bounded that he may not trade in all places Page  14 to other mens disadvantage: nothing but an emulous desire to interfere with others, and to incumber trade could provoke men to be opposite to our regular distributions. I need not amplifie hereupon, tis enough that I further refer to the example of our thriving Neighbours in Holland; whosoever will behold Order in its beauty, and perfection amongst Merchants there, He may observe them so politickly associated, and their Associations so equally distributed, that no one impedes the other abroad, nor no one Town ingrosses all Trading to it self at home. Hitherto I have instanced in the manifold expediences of Or∣der, and Government, especially in matters of piety, equity, cha∣rity, and policy as well in relation to the Common weal of Mer∣chants, as to the Common-weal of England: now whether there be any thing in freedom of Trading that can preponderate, and excell all these, I leave to all sober men to discern; if there be, I wish it may prevail, and obtain a just preference before all these: if there be not, more need not be inferred out of these premisses: sober men cannot be affected with the name, or empty sound of a relative, that is rather to be judged by its circumstances, effects, and additions then by it self: sober men cannot but distinguish betwixt that true freedome which alwayes dis-inthrals us of some evill, and that shadowy ghost of freedome, which often de∣nudes us of our greatest priviledges. I hope I have now dischar∣ged, what was to be expected from me in my first point, and made it apparent that the freedom in Trade which is to be ad∣measured, and ballanced with all these expediences here enume∣rated had not need to be of large extension. It remains now that I come to my next head, and therein in∣quire whether trade be likely to flourish or no, being stripped, and robbed of all those powers and preeminences which our Charters convey to us. I have hitherto lookt upon Merchants as Travaylers sojourn∣ing abroad, I must now come neerer, and looke upon them as ve∣ry Merchants, buying, selling, bartering, bargaining, &c. with other Nations; & from generall Order, and harmony amongst Merchants, I must come to instance in such, and such species of that Order, and harmony, which has hitherto been so fortunate to them. And first let us looke into that provision of our Govern∣ment, which limits the education, and admission of Apprentices, & though I have not leisure to cite all our rules concerning the Page  15 same which are very many, & each of them very usefull, yet consi∣der the sumum genus it self, see if the breeding of Apprentices be not absolutely necessary. Grant to all without exception an open license to trade at large, & who will indure the strict duty and bondage of Apprenticehood? and yet without that strict duty, and bondage, who can be sufficiently instructed, and pre∣pared to gaine all those Arts, and subtilties, which we know are absolutely necessary to all Traders. In all sciences, and occupa∣tions breeding is necessary, but amongst Merchants it is more then ordinarily necessary: For if Divines may pretend somthing to divine, secret illapses from above; and souldiers by their generall tacticks learned in one Countrey, may be qualified for command in all Countries; and if agriculture be a skill that de∣pends much upon naturall sagacity: yet with Merchants 'tis far otherwise. For unto a Merchant not onely a breeding, but a particular breeding in such or such a place, in such or such a Trade is requisite. He that is experienced to trade in Russia is not thereby inabled to trade in Spaine, and he that can deale warily enough with Indians, Turks and Barbarians, is not alwaies prepa∣red enough to cope with the Jews, Hans Townes, and Hollanders. Questionlesse to license all men to trade without breeding, nay without the particular advertisements, and preparations of such a breeding is to send men naked into battell, and to ren∣der them up as a prey to vulpine, circumventing neighbours. I might here take occasion to commend the training up of our Youths on this side the seas, as it is publickly advantagious, there being infused into them thereby somthing of the Souldier, and somthing of the Scholler, and indeed (if I am not deceived) there is commonly instilled somthing into them, that better qualifies them to serve the State, then what we see in meere Schollers or Souldiers. I wish our young gallants which learn in France to weare ribbons, and in Spain and Italy to be perfidious, and do worse things, did alwayes return home as much improved, and as well accomplisht as our Merchants use to do. But this is not within my lists, and that thought shall supersede me. For our next evidence, we may appeal unto our many Orders made to prevent, and reform, the ill and faulty making or Cloth, and other English woollen Commodities, without which Orders all our Manufactures would be falsified, and corrupted, and con∣sequently Page  16 our Nation disparaged, all buyers of Cloth at home, and abroad abused, and Trade it self much desolated. At the sol∣licitation of our Merchants, wholsome Statutes have been Enact∣ed, and to second them strict Proclamations have been publisht: and to back them the Merchants have appointed Officers, fur∣nisht stipends, and applyed divers other preventions, that our Draperies might be kept to their just measures, weights, and numbers; yet we find all is too little. The Clothiers begin to so∣phisticate of late more then ever, and all our power will be insuf∣ficient to withstand them; except the State reach forth their help∣ing hands yet further; and do more exactly poize both our ends and pretensions. The clamors of the Clothiers against the Mer∣chants priviledges arise chiefly from this offence, though they are commonly palliated with other pretexts, and tis a wondrous thing, that when they are sensibly gainers by transgressing Laws, and we are as sensibly at a charge to maintain them, they should be so well, and we so ill interpreted. In my Lord Cooks opinion nine parts of ten of all our English Staple Commodities, are such as we sheere from the Sheeps back, we had need therefore be carefull how abuses break in upon us in these Commodities, and how we countenance those that are the abusers, and yet thereby discountenance the zealous reform∣ers of the same. M: Anth: Wither is now a Justice of Peace about London, He was once imployed by the Merchant Adventurers besides others about reforming of these abuses, let it be inquired what a liberall yeerly stipend He obtained for the same. In the third place we may produce our many prudent Orders against mis-shipping, whereby, first, the Shipping of the Kingdom is the better maintained, in as much as by our government it is not permitted to any particular men for cheapnesse sake either to ship in forrein bottoms, or in vessels of our own that are unde∣fensible. Secondly, by our regularity in shipping many fraudu∣lent attempts of such as use to steal customes, bribe searchers, colour strangers goods, &c. are disappointed. Thirdly, by the due observation of our rules, whilest we ship our goods hand in hand together we go stronger through the Seas, are in lesse fear of Rovers, and other dangers. We also are lesse injurious to our common Trade, yea and to particular persons amongst our¦selves: in as much as now we forestall not one another, nor bring Page  17 down our common prices by the precipitate haste of some few; by this means also forrein buyers are accommodated by their certainty, knowing in due season when to repair to our Marts; and we are not disaccommodated by our uncertainty, because we know when to sell, and when to forbear selling, and thereby we keep our Commodities from being blown upon, either by having our. Ware-houses too full at sometimes, or too empty at others. In the fourth place, the many Cautions, Orders made by us for the reglement of our sales may justly be here cited: by some of these, we are limited to such certain shew-dayes partly for our own ease, and partly for the buyers advantage. The Cities of Lubeck and Bremen have lately been urgent with us to set more shew-dayes here at Hamburgh then two in a week: but we seeing our Trade no ampler, then it is at present, found the inconveni∣ence of altring our Shew dayes, and so denied them satisfaction in that point. By others of our Orders we are restrained from gi∣ving gratifications to Merchants or Brokers, from all pety sales, and retails, which (if allowed) would reduce us soon to ignoble, vulgar Pedlars: by others we are bound from giving credit without liquid Bils, and specialties, also from pawning Bils, or rebating under such a certain rate, and hereby we prevent ma•y Suits with strangers, and many strifes amongst our selves. By others we are inhibited from allowing Tare out of the Mart Town, or out of due time, or without due inspection: and we are all convinced, that were it not for regulation in this matter of Tare, there were no abiding in Germany. How our Trade lan∣guishes in Holland at this time by reason of Oppression in matter of Tare is known too well, our Councell Table in King James his dayes took notice of it, and sought the redresse of it: and sure our Merchants hitherto have onely continued trading there, out of some hope of better times, and conditions hereafter, as Hus∣bandmen use to manure the earth in times of dearth, as well as in times of plenty. Commissioners from Lubeck and Bremen se∣conded by the Senate of this Town have assailed us lately, and eagerly pressed us to allow the same Tare, as is in Holland, but our answer was resolute, that rather then to submit to such a thraldome we should be forced to abandon all Trade in Germany. Many more instances then these (if it were not for prolixity) Page  18 might be made: but as those which have any knowledge in Merchandice will acknowledge these are matters of grand mo∣ment, and importance: so to other men that are ignorant, or carelesse of our affairs, more would be to little purpose. I will onely adde this, that as we injoy many conveniencies by being an united, imbodied Fraternity, so by vertue of the same we are guarded and protected from many inconveniences. As we have a jurisdiction amongst us, we are inabled upon all new emergen∣cies to contravene new devised arts of fraud, and circumvention in bargaining, selling, &c. by making new Orders against them. Also as we are a Corporation, we are armed thereby with a competence of power to inforce, & execute our Orders so made, and if any violence of forrein States, and Potentates contrary to our Intercourses, and Treaties of amitie enterposes to our preju∣dice, or if any new Tolls, imposts, or exactions oppresse us, we are in this posture better qualified to relieve, or vindicate our selves, then else we should be. A thousand private men intend∣ing their own particular interests as so many particular men, having no common purse, nor publick Officers to solicite the busines of them all, cannot expect that authority with forrein States, nor hope to make so vigorous a resistance against oppres∣sions and innovasions, as one hundred Merchants may, that are closely linked, and cemented together under one, and the same policie. For want of such policie, all other Nations were long since eaten out of their Trade by the Antwerpians, and Esterlings, and had the Merchant Adventurers been destitute of those po∣wers, and immunities which Hen: the 4th. Hen: the 7th. and o∣ther famous Kings of England establisht amongst them, they also had been long since driven out of Trade in like manner. One man is woolvish to another, as the old Proverbe adver∣tises, nay when Bears will not prey upon Bears, nor woolfes up∣on woolfes, man will scarce prey upon any other then man. And yet this notwithstanding private man to private man is not so unnaturall; as Nation is to Nation: for amongst particular 〈◊〉 the primary Lawes of our Creation, which injoyne us to do as we would be done unto, and to be kindest to them that are nee•est in kinde, are not so totally abrogated to us, and eraced on of our consciences, as they are amongst Nations. If there be any fiercer feude, and violenter antipathy then Page  19 other, tis commonly seem amongst those States that are most con∣sanguineous, and neerest conjoyned in other relations, and as for doing to other Nations, as we would have done unto us; that sems a ridiculous principle amongst Stats-men, inasmuch as to do justice to a stranger when he is plaintiffe against a Native, is no lesse reputed then to do injustice to a Native: and to let slip any advantage whatsoever that is offered us of spoyling forreiners, is the same accounted as to spoile domesticks. Republicks have no breasts, or seats where any such thing as conscience or true honour can reside; were it not for fear of re∣quital, and return of injuries from those that are injured, all peo∣ple would be at the same passe, as Argiers is now at. That bold Roman that expostulated with Alexander, why it might not be as lawfull for him to seize boats, as it was for Prin∣ces to invade whole Empires, seemed to conceive that the Laws of Nature extended to communities of men, as well as to indi∣vidualls: but alas that would neither justifie his private roving at sea; nor condemne Alexanders royall roving by land. In matters of warre Monarchies especially, and in matters of Trade Republicks, lay hold of all advantages, as if their patri∣moniall rights were never bounded by any thing but invincible difficulties, and necessities, nor honour had any rules to measure things by but those of profit, and disprofit. This is the reason why the Jewish Lumbards are odious for their excessive gains exacted, and extorted out of all such as they contract with, and therefore are pursued as petty Pirats: but the Hollanders and Hans Townes for the same exploits done more publickly are extolled as great Merchants, nay are crowned as glorious Conquerors. We that live here in Hamburgh, and our Brethren in Holland are too sensible of this: our often removals from one Mart Town to another, to ease our selves of insuppor∣table pressures most fedifragously brought in upon us, have pre∣served that life in our English Trade that is yet remaining in it: yet the vast expences of our removings have left us in a sad con∣dition. This concludes my two first points: I am now in order to an∣swer such arguments as are brought for a free Trade, and such ob∣jections as are urged against our priviledged way of Trading. The first Argument is founded upon this maxime: Bonum quo Page  20 communius, eo melius: If Merchandize (say our Adversaries) be good for the Common-weal, then the more common it is made, the more open it is layd, the more good it will convey to us. But all grant Merchandize to be good •rgo. Ans. To detect the fallacies of this Argument: we must confesse that this maxime is true of all such good things as are absolutely, or infinitely good: yet we may deny that Merchandize is either absolutely, or infi∣nitely good. For first, Merchandize secundum quid, that is, if it be rightly managed, and regulated may be profitable to such a man, or such a State: but (we all see) that Merchandize at some∣times, for want of good government, and order, undoes many private men, and in their undoing proves injurious to the State. Secondly, Merchandize may be reckoned amongst good things, but not amongst things infinitely good, therefore though the diffusion, or inlargement of it may bring profit to the State unto such bounds, and degrees; yet this is no proof, but that there are bounds, and degrees beyond which it may not be diffused, nor can be inlarged without disprofit. Those good things which are ample enough to satisfie all, may be extended to all, and the further they are extended, the more good they do: but Trade is not of that amplitude as to satisfie all men in all places, and at all times, and therefore not within the same Maxime. If there were in the fruits, and increase of the earth an over-flowing abundance to sustain all, and answer all mens desires without our labour and sweat, then hedges and ditches would be to no purpose: but since the earth is not so profuse of its favours, nor so immense in its revenues, we must maintain mounds, and ter∣riers; priority of possession, expence of toyl, purchase, &c. must be regarded, or else we shall all be soon at a losse. Before the Land of Canaan was fully stockt, Abraham and Lot might intercommon freely, and graze their Herds sociably in all places where they travelled; but in processe of time, when their flocks became more numerous, and when consequently the sur∣face of that milk-and honey flowing Countrey began to shrink before them, they were both necessitated to journey severall wayes, and to provide for themselves more •…x•, and distinct ha∣bitations. The water is a more unmeasured element then the earth, and therefore formerly it was ever held a common patri∣mony to all: yet since Navigation is improved to this degree, Page  21 even this also is now disterminated, and made subject to imagi∣nary lives for avoiding of incroachments, and strife about fish∣ings, &c. And not onely navigable Rivers, but Seas, and Oceans begin to submit to particular Proprieties, and to own the speci∣all prerogatives of such, and such signiors. Lawyers say, Cujus est Solum, ejus est etiamus{que} ad Coelum: wherefore if neither Aire, Water, nor Land resist the Laws of propriety, we cannot think the Trade of Merchants is a thing more emptie, and uncapable of limits and rules, then any of the Elements: if our grounds may be pester'd with cattell; if Ponds may be over-stockt with Fish; if the several Climates of the lower Region be severally peopled, and frequented with fowl that seem to understand their severall seasons: we can hardly imagine that such a Countrey, or such a Mart Town in such a Countrey should not be over-charged with too great a confluence of Merchants. Second Argument. That which seizes too great matters into the hands of too few, and so is in the nature of a Monopoly, has been alwayes condemned as a preventing Trade, and held inju∣rious to the major part of mankind: but such is the Trade which priviledged, and incorporated Merchants drive, &c. Ans. The force of this Objection is, that if Trade may not be set at liberty to all, yet it may be set at liberty to more then it is, except we will incur the name and blame of Monopolists. In be∣half of the Merchant Adventurers who have, I think, the fullest Charters, & have ever met with the greatest oppositions, though I am not so well acquainted with other Companies, I may with much confidence give these Answers hereunto. First, though Wools endraped be the main matter of our Trade, yet we deal not onely in those Draperies, but also in all kinds of Wares, and, other Merchandizes. Secondly, neither doth our Company alone transport these Draperies: all other English Merchants, nay the Hans Towns, and all other Strangers in amity with the Crown of England, at their pleasure may buy, and vend again all sorts of English Wares that are fully manufactured, as uncontrollably as they bring in their own Commodities. Wherefore it cannot be said that this chief Trade of the Kingdom is ingrossed, or mo∣nopoliz'd by us in either of these two respects, for as much as our priviledges neither confine that Trade to us alone, nor us to that Trade alone. Page  22 Thirdly, The name of Monopolists cannot be fixed on them in respect of the bounds allotted them for their Trade: for by cal∣culation we finde there are above 6000 persons free of our Com∣pany, and from the Some in France to the Scaw in Germany, (the nihil ultraes of our commerce) is no extraordinary proportion, for such a proportion of men, let the number of the Merchant Adventurers be compared with the number of all other Mer∣chants, and then compare this space of earth in France and Ger∣many with all the globe besides; and it will soon appeare, that the confines of our Trade are rather too narrow, then other∣wise. Some hundreds, nay thousands of our Company that are capable of our freedome by service, or by Patrimony are faine to leave their callings, & to betake themselves to other imploy∣ments: and necessity hath now taught us to confine our selves to a certaine stint of Apprentices, in regard that our Trade is too narrow for our Traders, & therefore whilest we are inforced to break out, what can invite other men thus to break in, and to invade our precincts? Fourthly, The price that is set upon our priviledges cannot condemne us of monopolie: for if a sufficient number could not be admitted by service, or patrimony: yet the State hath left a door open for any that are qualified for trading to be ad∣mitted upon a meane, inconsiderable rate. Any Out Port Merchant might have had his freedome for 25. l. ster•ing, and any of London for 50. l. and those which neglected that opportunity, are yet capable for the double summe. Fifthly, The stint which we set upon our selves in buying cloth cannot be objected to us, as savouring of monopolie: For first the whole Company by common advice, and consent sets this stint for its own good; and as the whole Company best under∣stands its own interest, so neither has it, or can it have any inter∣est, but such as is consistent with the interest of the State. 2ly, the Company had never resolved upon any such stint, but in con∣templation of the narrownesse of Trade: and so far is this stint from making trade more scarce, that it self was ordained meerly as some ease and remedie against the scarcity of Trade. We know well that tis possible for some one Merchant to exceed fourty others in purse, or credit; yet sure it cannot be expedient for the Common-wealth, that one Merchant should graspe too Page  23 much, and swell up to an excessive bulk, whilest fourty other Mer∣chants being over shadowed by him, can attain to no growth at all. Thirdly, As the stint of Clothes is now set, it remains larger then is made use of by diverse, the fourth part of our Merchants scarce ever buyes to the fourth part of Clothes that is allowable by the stint, wherefore it is a most indirect and preposterous thing to call that a monopolie, or straitning of Trade; which is the onely remedie against monopolie, & the meer effect of strait∣n•sse in Trade. They which know the difference betwixt Common certain, and Common sans number; and see how the Husbandman in dressing his vine, makes it more fruitfull by paring away the luxuriant products of its fertility, wil easily judge by these stints, that the Merchants were grown too numerous for their Trade, and not that their Trade was grown too copious for their man∣naging. Sixtly, As our Trade cannot be called an ingrossing Trade, or a monopolie in respect of any other of its priviledges or powers, so neither can it be accused thereof in regard of our covinous, false dealing in Marchandize. Tis true, our Company in Qu: Elizabeths daies found much opposition from the Hans Townes, and in that bando which was procured against us, to remoove us from Stadt, the main pretence was monopolie used by the English Merchants, but for a further Account of that mat∣ter, we are to be informed: that the Hans Towns had antiently by their great skill in Merchandize, made themselves very fa∣mous, and procured to themselves priviledges in many Coun∣tries. Amongst other Nations also that did priviledge them, the English was not the last, or least. In London therefore they had the Steelyard assigned them with power to exercise Merchant Law there, for their own better re∣gulation: and amongst many other old immunities, they were to pay for wares brought in, and carried out one and a quarter per centum custome, and no more. This Custome whilest the cheife Trade of the land was in Wooll undraped, was no great losse to us: but after that the full Art of clothing was made ours in Ed: the 3ds. daies, and the Wooll Trade was almost quite decaied, our State found that it lost exceedingly by passing out cloth at the old Custome, and Page  24 that the Hans Towns priviledges were diverse otherwaies abu∣sed to our publick detriment. Hereupon after some contests, (Ed: the 6th. raigning Anno 1550.) the said priviledges were lookt into, and found both defective in themselves, and also for∣feited by diverse breaches of conditions: the formalities of their incorporation were so voide, that none could safely con∣tract with them, and therefore being detected of diverse injuries in colouring of forrein goods, not within the verge of their pri∣viledges, and other falshoods: it appeared, that they were such an uncertain, misconstituted body, that they were not lia∣ble to any account, nor answerable for any trespasse. This procured a judgment to annull, and abrogate the Hans Towns priviledges, and in Anno 1557. under Phil: and Mary, our Customes were improoved from 14. d. to 6. s. 8. d. per Cloth payable by the English and 13. s. 4. d. by strangers, and this improovement did but equall the old Custome of wooll undra∣ped. Till the death of Q: Mary, whilest Spain and England were united, the Hans Townes seeing their profit so far impared, and Trade in England in so good a measure advanced, gr•w sullenly envious, but durst attempt nothing. Neverthelesse Anno 1564 when Queen Elizabeth was at enmity with the Spanyard, with more resumed courage the Hans Towns laboured to suppresse the growth of our Merchandize: and ther∣fore to make the King of Spaine their abettor against us in Ger∣many, and the Netherlanders, they made themselves parties a∣gainst us in Spaine, by furnishing armes, amunition, &c. Thus some acts of hostility were done on both sides, Queen Elizabeth in a defensive way seized some of their Ships sent to supply the Spanyard, and the Spanyard at their solicitation banisht us out of the Low Countries, and caused us to be interdicted Germany also. Anno 1567. the English Merchants being expelled out of the Netherlands, contracted for entertainment at Hamburgh for 10 yeers: these 10 yeers being expired, no longer residence could be had there, inasmuch as all the Hans Towns could not injoy us wholly to themselves, & for any one to injoy us, they thought it unequall, and prejudiciall to the rest. From Hamburgh we remooved to Embden, and there the same Page  25 parties prosecuting and renewing their clamors of a monopo∣lizing Trade in the English, a new Edict from the Emperor Anno 1582. was thundered out against us. The Grave of Embden no∣thing troubled at this Edict, sent his Chancellor Doctor Moller, since Syndicus of Hamburgh to the Spiers, who there defended the English Trade against the slanderous imputation of monopo∣lie, and for a while gave such satisfaction, that the Emperours Edict was not put in execution against us. Queen Elizabeth also in 1595. wrote thus to the Emperour, Monopolium de quo Hanseatici subditos nostros criminantur calumniae potius quam verae accusationis rationem per se ferre videtur. To wipe off this calumny, we can also instance in severall letters of atte∣station under the Common Seals of Antwerpe, Midlebourgh, Emb∣den, Stadt justifying our faire, and just manner of trading: and if such legible proofs be not so available, wee could appeal to all the places where ever we resided, as so many visible argu∣ments, prooving fully for us, that our way of traffick hath not been onely blamelesse, and just, but also strangely fortunate and propitious. From Embden (for the Spanyard prevailing in Freisland had now made those parts dangerous to us) we betook our selves to Stadt, and there we continued till 1597. so desirous was each of the Hans Towns singly to have harboured us, if all jointly had not envied that single advantage: and being there then disac∣commodated, 10. or 11. of the cheife Towns under the States sent to invite us, and made offers of large accommodations amongst them. We may further take notice, that Ed: the 6th. reserved for the Hans Towns after forfeiture of their priviledges, as ample a freedome of commerce, as for any strangers whatsoever: That Queen Mary restored the said Towns upon ingagement that their inordinate Trade should be forborne, and this ingagement be∣ing violated, She yeelded to a new Treaty about a sit modera∣tion of their Intercourses. Yet the Hans Towns did not onely neglect to send Commissioners within the time perfixed, but at the same time publisht an Edict at Lu•eck, prohibiting all Trade with the English, Queen Mary for her husbands sake was much a freind to the Austrian familie, and for the Austrians sake to Page  26 these Easterlings, and therefore she offered again another Trea∣tie in 1557. but this offer was rejected likewise with an oppro∣brious pretence, that in England they could expect no competent Judges of their cause. If they durst not trust their cause to England in Q: Maries dayes, because it was a Monarchy, then they judged dishonorably of all Monarchies: if they made no difference of Monarchies, but diffided in it, because it was a forrein State, where they should not be their own Judges, this reflects also up∣on all forrein States: but the truth is, they had an ill cause, and so were diffident of all Judges, but themselves. Howsoever Queen Elizabeth in 1560. offered yet a new Moderation, and this not accepted of from the beginning of her Reign, she commanded they should be used here as her own Subjects, and better then any other Forreiners. This is also most certain, till She saw her Subjects driven from Hamburgh in 1578. and an exaction of 7 ¼. per centum set upon all English Goods at Lunenburgh in 1579. and all the English generally ill Treated at Dantzig, Deventer, &c. and not onely her Enemies of Spaine assisted by them, but other Princes also exasperated against Her, She made little difference betwixt them and her own Subjects. I hope this will be a suffici∣ent justification of our English Trade: and now since it appears, that this opposition was procured to us by strangers and ene∣mies, that sought not to reduce us to a fair Trade, but to eject us out of all Trade: me thinks it should be very unworthy of any Englishman to make use of the same Objections. 3. Arg: That Trade which is not onely complained of by Strangers, but Natives also, and in all ages has encountred with so many Complainants, is likely to be a Monopolie, or some private, anticipating, indirect way of commerce: but such is that of all Merchants incorporated by particular Charters, &c. All priviledged Merchants, especially the Adventurers of England (whose priviledges are lookt upon as so ample) have had Adversaries alwaies to wrestle, and contest with both abroad, and at home: yet this may be truly said of them (as of Cato) they have been as often absolved, as accused: and their Patrons have ever been far more honorable, then their Adversaries. Clothiers, Interlopers, some Officers of the Outports, and Court projectors have molested them on the one side: but on the other side Parlia∣ments, Page  27 Kings, Privy-Councellors, and the wisest of Statesmen have protected them, and their Cause; and upon a full, and due hearing it continually appeared, that their friends had honour∣able, but their opposers dishonourable ends. As for the Clothier, He stomacks much that He must be so strictly held to the Statute, and may not digresse from the just weight, and measure, that is there set for his Clothes. The Interloper takes offence, that with∣out contributing for Himself, He may not injoy the benefits of that policy, which is maintained at other mens charge: that the same hedges which keep other men from trespassing him, should keep him from trespassing other men. The Outport Officer is pre∣vented of some bribes, for stolne customes, false-colour'd goods, &c. by the regular shipping of our Merchants, and by our Mini∣sters, which keeps too severe a check upon him, and therefore his indignation is raised. In the mean time the begging Courtier, He finds it profitable for the Common-wealth, that accusations should be favoured, and that all Complainants should be heard: for whether the Complaints be true or false, just, or unjust, profit comes in to Him both wayes, and the Innocent must gratifie him for his quietus est, as well as the nocent for his impunity. King James anno 1613. found that his Progenitors had been deceived in their Grants to us, and therefore suspended and sequestred our Priviledges: but in anno 1616▪ and 1617. after that the Mer∣chants had been drained of 20, or 30000 l. and Cockayns new pro∣ject (so obstructive to Trade) was falne to the ground of it self, the same ancient Charters, and Liberties were revived with more honourable testimonials then ever; the Courtiers were again sensible that King James and his Progenitors had been well ad∣vised in their Grants. The Merchants Adventurers long before the Art of Endra∣ping Cloth was introduced into England, had Priviledges abroad from the Dukes of Brabant, and other Potentates. Edw: the 3d. having transplanted the Manufacture out of the Netherlands, for the better watering, and cherishing of it, confirmed to the said Adventurers whatsoever had been granted in the yeer 1248. by John D: of Brabant. Hen: the 4th. seeing the good effects of his grandfathers indulgence, added a more beneficiall and large Charter of priviledges in Feb: 1406. H. 5. H. 6. Edw: 4. and R. 3.Page  28 were followers of that good example by severall ratifications, But H. 7. seeming to transcend all his Predecessors in policie, and desiring to testifie the same by his care of Merchants, proceeded further to dilate their priviledges, and preeminences. Polydor Virgil gives him this Encomium: Mercatores ille saepenumerò pecuniâ multa data gratuito juvibat, u• Mercatura (A•s una •n•ctis aeque mor∣talibus tum commoda, tum necessaria) in surregno copiofier esset. In his Reigne (enmities and hostilities interrupting our commerce with the Burgundians) we had a Staple provided for us at Calais; and then under our own Soveraigne, within our own Domini∣ons we saw our own fellow Subjects as tenderly entertained with divers Franchises, and Indulgences, as if they had capitulated with a strange Prince. Since H. 7. all his Successors have confirmed, or inlarged what was granted before; within few yeers also this King; and since that, this Parliament in 1643. have added strong ratifications, and that not without honourable acknowledgements of this fa∣mous Companies services to the publick. Moreover in the times of Hen: 4. and Hen: 7. some Complaints were preferred by Clothiers, &c. against the Merchant Adventurers: but after due examination, and hearing, the Company had a favourable issue, and not onely obtained a fuller establishment of former Charters, but also new expresse clauses against stragling Mer∣chants, and all other intermedlers, that might empeach, or di∣sturbe their Trade. Other Informations were under Edw: 6. ex∣hibited against the same Company by some of their own Bre∣thren: but after the Councell Table had taken a full cognizance thereof, the two chief of the Informers were committed to the Fleet, and the rest were Fined, and more strictly injoyned to sub∣mit to the Companies Orders for the future. The same Inform∣ers also not so acquiescing, made new addresses to the Parlia∣ment held after by Queen Mary: but the busines was soon quash∣ed there also, and the accusers without further remedie dis∣missed. The like or more grievous Complaints were revived by the Clothiers, &c. in Queen Elizabeths dayes, but what event did at∣tend them? after that the Cloth Trade was set at liberty for a while, after that the George at Westminster was made as free a Page  29 Mercat for Cloth as Blackwell-Hall in London, and upon triall the poore people of Wiltshire, Glocestershire, &c. saw their miseries not relieved, but increased by dissolving the Company of Merchant Adventurers: The Lords of the Councell anno 29. Eliz: to pre∣vent mutiny in those parts, were fain to send for the Merchant Adventurers, and desire them cheerfully to proceed in their Trade, to which no countenance, nor assistance from them should be wanting for the future. Alderman Cockayns Project in King James his dayes was guild∣ed over with a more specious pretext then that in Queen Eliza∣beths, and when our Company was at that time dissolved, Trade was not absolutely layd common (as before) without all man∣ner of regulation: but to prevent general confusion (which had proved it self continually so fatall) a new Company was erect∣ed, and incorporated: yet neither so could this project prosper, or subsist. King James in his Proclamation Anno 1617. publisht for the restitution of our Company and its and 〈◊〉 Priviledges, (after that the consumption, and miserable languishment of Trade for above two yeers space had better instructed him) at∣testated to the world the excellent method, and discipline of our ancient Corporation, and now ineffectuall his 〈◊〉 looser juris∣diction had proved for the vending of our 〈◊…〉 manu∣facture. And it should seem this was susti•••…〈◊…〉 the world, yet the Courtiers would not be so satisfied for they thought they had gratified the Common-wealth in restoring the ancient Company of the Adventurers, and that they had grati∣••• the Merchant Adventurers in restoring them to their due rights, and therefore to inclose by bargain for themselves a gra∣tification of 20, or 30000 li. was no ill office. There is another clog remaining upon our Trade to this day, and it is continued still upon the same reason: the Merchant Ad∣venturers at first were stinted to a certain number of Clothes, which number in their exportations they might not exceed: now it appears since to the State, that that number was too strait, and that it is very inexpedient for Trade to circumscribe our Mer∣chants rigorously with that stint; and yet notwithstanding Courtiers must be •ill feed for releasing Trade of this inexpe∣dience. The Earl of Cumberland in Queen Elizabeths dayes was Page  28〈1 page duplicate〉Page  29〈1 page duplicate〉Page  28〈1 page duplicate〉Page  29〈1 page duplicate〉Page  30 sweetned with a Present for obtaining an inlargement of our stint; but that Present now is become a Rent, and is successively granted by Patent; and though the Patentee be a single person, and cannot be said properly to gratifie the Common-wealth, yet He receives such a yeerly revenue in consideration that the Com∣mon-wealth shall not be disserved: and this revenue it self being an Incumbrance upon our Draperies, and raised out of Wooll∣growers, Clothiers, Merchants Retailors, and so charging Trade in generall, is no lesse then a disservice it self to the Common-wealth. Thus we see our Charters have been often times, and se∣verall wayes attempted against: and yet if they had not been so much shaken, their power of resistance had not been so experi∣mentally known; for the more the Anchor is straitned, the faster hold it ever gains. 4th. Arg: Since every man is presumed to be most knowing in that Craft wherein He has been bred up; we may presume the Clothiers in matters of cloth to be more knowing then the Mer∣chant. Ans. First, in the making of Cloth we deny not but there may be more skill in the Clothier then in the Merchant: but the que∣stion here is about the uttering and vending, not about working or preparing of cloth: and therfore, it follows not that the breed∣ing of the Clothier does so much inable him to sell cloth, especi∣ally in great quantities, and that to forrein Nations, as the Mer∣chants: but rather the contrary, even by the truth of the same granted rule. Forasmuch as there is not onely an Art and Myste∣rie in the sale of cloth as aforesaid, but also an Art more abstrase, eminent, and exquisite then that is which consists in the Mecha∣nicall way of making and dressing the same. Secondly, the State is not to consider what is most beneficiall to the Merchant, what to the Clothier separatim, or whether the benefit of the one alone, or of the other be more to be favour∣ed, but how they may be both favoured conjunctim, and how the State may be most benefited by twisting their interests both to∣gether. Now then generall interest of the State requires that all our L•nificia, or English commodities be raised in price unto other Nations as high as may be without injustice, or inconvenience, and that as many persons and professions in England as may be, Page  31 may come to be sharers in the generall interest. If the question then be, whether the Merchants interest, or the Clothiers do more conduce to this publick reason of State; sense it self will presently distinguish, that the Merchants advantage is more compliant with the publick then the Clothiers. For the Clothi∣ers ayme is to drown that gain, which the Merchants industry and imployment now serves for, and which by his service is kept within the bounds of our own Island, to the maintaining of so many families at home, and busying so many men, and Ships abroad, and thereby to abridge the same the more to Natives, the more it is publicated unto strangers. The Hollanders are so subtill as to clog our English Woollen manufactures with great Impositions, and to free their own of the same, that the prices of their meaner Draperies may be raised up to our better ones, or the prices of our better Draperies may be beaten down to their meaner ones: but our subtiltie must be for the pleasure of our Clothiers to intercept from the Merchants all that liveli∣hood which they now earn, and by vilifying of our own Wares to prostitute the same unto Strangers: nay and by the same means to expose themselves to the danger of having worse trea∣tance from forreiners, then now they have from their own Coun∣treymen. Thirdly, if more regard be had of the Clothier, then of the Merchant, or State, yet constant experience teaches us, that this favour and preference which the Clothier challenges herein above the Merchant, is no reall favour, nor preference at all. For it has been alwayes seen, that the setting at liberty of the Mer∣chants Trade has proved more obstructive to the Clothier then to the Merchant, in as much as the Merchant has a more large imployment, and can better subsist without the Clothier, then the Clothier can without the Merchant. Moreover as it doth not alwayes fall out, that the breaking up of the Merchants Trade brings any present quicknesse to Trade: so if it doth, that quick∣nesse never •a••s; 'tis but bonum presens; 'tis but like cold water to a feaverish man, it procures some short refreshment, but repays that short refreshment within a short space after with a prolon∣gation of sharper extremities. So it proved it in Qu: Elizabeths times; so it proved in King James his times; and so it is likely to Page  32 prove hereafter: wherefore if men of Mechanicall education will onely contemplate present things, and neither look forward nor backward, Statesmen may, and must disaccommodate them for the present, that they may be accommodated the better for the future. 5th. Arg: That power in private men which onerates the chief Commodities of the Realm with arbitrary impositions to maintain it self, is dangerous: but such is the Merchants power, &c. Ans. Our Companies ordinary charge is scarce consider∣able in respect of the great summes we deal for; and the extra∣ordinary charge is alwayes drawn on by some extraordinarie, unavoidable inconvenience: for example, the removals of our Residence from one Mart Town to another is commonly a great burthen to us, but that burthen is undertaken to avoid some greater detriment, and without it either we should loose old pri∣viledges, or be made to submit to some new exactions: or be some other way aggrieved in a worse degree. Now this is for the com∣mon good, and we may rather expect favour from the Kingdom, then disfavour for such services. Secondly, we have a Bill now in the Houses, prepared for His Majesties Assent, and in that Bill the future Impositions of our Company are reduced to a certaintie. Thirdly, there is an absolute necessity of these Impositions, for neither can our Trade prosper without government, nor govern∣ment be maintained without some charge: neither is our govern∣ment necessary onely for our selves, but also for the Clothier, for as much as we are a good skreen, or bank betwixt the Mer∣chant stranger, and the English Clothier, and were not the prices of our clothes kept up by us, and that partly by the charge of our government, the Clothier would be more inslaved to the Stranger, then now He is. Lastly, our Accounts are kept most exactly, and audited pun∣ctually, and the hands through which all things passe are so many that there can be no error, nor fraud. The Hans Towns in Germany, anciently 72. in number, found it expedient to incor∣porate, and maintain a common correspondence: for which end Lubeck of the Wendish, Brunswick of the Saxon, Dantzig of the Prusse, and Cullen of the Westphalish Towns was appointed to be Page  33 chief; and the chief of all was Lubeck. These Towns so united for adjusting all common, and particular interests obtained se∣verall places of Residence in England at London, in Norway at Ber∣gen, in Russia at Novograde: in the Netherlands at Antwerpe: and in each of these residencies they had their Alderman, Assistants, Se∣cretaries, Treasurers, Stewards, and other Officers, by whom their publick affairs were administred, and Merchant Law was exercised. Wherefore if the expence of their government was more then countervailed by the benefit of their unity; and if they were gainers by that expence, why should that be impru∣dent in us which was prudent in them? or why should that be dammage to us, which was profit to them? The ordinary pleas for Freedom are thus answered, and the Objections against Reglement in Trade removed; we will now onely re-inforce all that has been said in a word, or two. The most solid glory, and magnificence that ever dazel'd hu∣mane eyes upon earth: was that of Solomons royall Court, at that time, when his unparralleld wisdome had made Silver as stones in Jerusalem, and Cedars as vulgar as Sycamores used to be in other places. Tis written of his raigne (by an inspired Author) that it made Silver of no account, that in one yeer there flowed into his Ex∣chequer 666 Talents of pure Gold; that besides all his Masses of Ophir gold, he abounded with other various Treasures, preci∣ous stones, &c. such as the Merchants of Spices, the Governours of the Countrie, and the Kings of Arabia did import. Solomon was no warriour, nor born Lord of many Nations, nor did his Jewish Signiory extend it selfe over any large Tract in the universe: tis onely written of him, that he had at Sea a Navie of Tarshish with Hirams, & the same Navie once in 3 years returned home fraigh∣ted with gold, silver, ivory &c. Hiram being hitherto straitned in the mediterranean Seas, could not gaine the Stronds of Arabia, Persia, India, China, &c. without incompassing the Capes or Afri∣ca, and crossing the Suns torrid line: but upon terms of partner∣ship Solomon is now able to let him in to that Southern Ocean by a way far more compendious. Pharaoh on the further side of the red sea is Solomons neer Allye: and the Edomites on this side are his tributary servants: hereup∣on Page  34 things▪ are so composed betwixt the Jews, and Tyrians, that it is as beneficiall for the Tyr•ans to serve the Jews with their skill in Astronomy, and Hidrography, as for the Jews to serve the Ty∣rians with their harbours, and ships. Therefore the Queen of Sheba (till her eyes were ascertained with substances) might well withhold her beleife from entertaining, that stupendious report which was blowne about the world concerning Solomon; and well might her spirit after sinke within her, when her eyes had once encountered with the radiant Majesty of Solomon, whereby the blasts of Fames Trumpet were so far drowned, and transcen∣ded. Of all Solomons successors we read of none but Jeh•saphat, that ever thought of rigging new navies in Ezion-geber; and He neverthelesse though he had the Edomites his homagers, and was also much renowned for his wisdome, and grandour, found this designe unfeasible, and the way to Ophir altogether unpassable. This is a cleer chrisis to indicate how profound the judgment, and how broad the comprehension of Solomon was, before whom (till apostacie had alien'd his God from him) no difficulties were able to stand: yet 'twas not so admirable in Solomon, that he amassed such incredible treasures, as that he amassed them by Peacefull arts, and not by the dint of his sword. The tragicall exploits of Alexander, and Caesar, may be accoun∣ted magna, & splendida Latrocinia, if they be compared to the feats of Merchandize exercised by Solomon and the other Kings of Tyre and Arabia; and yet we may doubt too, whether the spoile of the East to Alexander, or of the West to Caesar were equall in va∣lue to all Solomons Cargazoons. Whilest the cruell•d predations of war impoverish, dispeople and by horrid devastations root up, and so shrinke (as it were) great Empires into small Provinces: Merchandise on the other side beautifies, inriches, impowers little States, and so al∣ters their naturall dimensions, that they seem to swell, as it were, into spacious Empires. This martiall Hero has inscribed upon his Statue: that he has fought so many picht battells, that he has ••th his rapid lightnings spread a suddain conflagration over so many Kingdomes; that with the losse of 100000 fellow Souldiers he has purchased the slaughter of 1000000 Enemies, at least such as he would needs make, and stile his Enemies. But Page  35 in the mean time that gentle unbloody Prince which by his se∣verall dispersed Carricks visits each climate of the world onely to plunder the Earths caverns of her Mettalls, or the Rocks of their Diamonds, or the Deepe it self of its pearles; merits to be celebrated for the common benefactor of mankind, aswell for the necessaries which he convaies unto other Nations, as for the more pretious wares▪ which he recovers out of the darke abisse of na∣ture, and relades for the use of his own Subjects. Howsoever this one instance of Solomon (to lay aside all other instances of Princes, that have engaged themselves in such like mercatorian negotiations) makes it plain, that the most Maje∣sticall of all Kings that ever raigned, was the most ample ad∣venturer that ever traffickt, and that he had not been so great a Prince, if he had not been so ample a Merchant: for it is more then probable that al the Tributes of Judea were inconsiderable in comparison of the returns which Tarshish did afford. It must needs follow therefore from the same very instance, that the devouring, piraticall Trade of war is not so honoura∣ble, or so fit to magnifie Princes, and make happie Nations, as that ingenious just Art of commerce, which may be exercised without rigor, or effusion of blood. I shall then close up all with this application to our own Nati∣on: if Merchandise be truly noble: if the raies which streamed so plentifull from Solomons diadem were more supplyde by traf∣fick, then by tribute; let not England totally neglect Merchants. Let us look into the causes that make Trade so dead amongst us at present, and the fittest remedies that possibly may recover it. In the East Indies we know who they are, that by cruelty have opprest us; In Russia we may take notice who they are, that by subtilty have supplanted us. Here in Germany our Priviledges are ill kept; in Holland they are worse. In many Countries the manufactures in Silkes, and Cot∣tonwools increase. In High, and Low Germany the store of sheep is increased, and of late the kinde of them especially in Silesia is much improoved, hereby, and by the help of Spanish woolls, nay of English woolls too, & Fullers Earth daily exported against Law, our English Draperies are extreamely brought low. The late obstructions and calamities of civill war in our King∣dome, Page  36 concurring with other annoyances done us by the Kings Agents abroad, and millitary Commissions upon the Sea, have added more to our ruine. Moreover, in other things the Times seeme to looke towards a Reformation, but in matters of Trade Order and regulation it self is opposed, and confusion under the Name of Liberty is now more then ever publickly pleaded for. The King by his Proclamation had formerly a •etted his Pro∣genitors grant to us, and the Parliament lately has corroborated the Kings Proclamations, yet nothing can secure as against in∣truding Interlopers. By this meanes Merchandize is brought to a low ebbe, 20 Ships yearly in former times did attend us here in Hamburgh, now 6. are sufficient to supply us, and though our Company be in this Consumption; some other Companies waste away worse then ours. All these mischeifs perhaps are not re∣mediable, yet let us use the best remedies we can, and such as are most seasonable. In Platoes Opinion those Common-wealths were most likely to prosper where learned men ruled, or Rulers were learned. Within the circle of Platoes learning let us comprehend the my∣steries of commerce. In Solomons dayes that kinde of learning did wonderfull things towards the advancing of States; and of late as Venice a City of Merchants has been the Bulwark of Eu∣rope against the Turk: so the Seates in the United Provinces by Trade more then Arms, have gotten the sword of Arbitration into their hands. Spain, and France, and other Nations no ware fain to court those Merchants, which not long since were belowe their scorn. Let it then be lawfull to propose: either that a cer∣tain number of able Merchants may be made Privy Councellors: or so many Privy Councellors specially designed to intend mat∣ters of Trade; or let some other H•••••… Councell be im∣powred solely▪ to promote the Common weal of Merchants.

In a Letter to the most Ingenious and Excellent Mrs. Katherine Phillips.  MADAM, THE wise Bensirach advised that we should not consult with a wo∣man concerning her of whom she is jealous, neither with a Coward in matters of War, nor with a Merchant concerning exchange; and some other instances he gives of interested per∣sons, Page  2 to whom he would not have us heark∣en in any matter of Counsel. For where ever the interest is secular or vicious, there the biass is not on the side of truth or re∣ason, because these are seldom serv'd by pro∣fit and low regards. But to consult with a friend in the matters of friendship is like consulting with a spiritual person in Reli∣gion; they who understand the secrets of Religion, or the interior beauties of friend∣ship are the fittest to give answers in all inquiries concerning the respective sub∣jects; because reason and experience are on the side of interest; and that which in friendship is most pleasing and most useful, is also most reasonable and most true; and a friends fairest interest is the best mea∣sure of the conducting friendships: and therefore you who are so eminent in friend∣ships could also have given the best answer to your own inquiries, and you could have trusted your own reason, because it is not only greatly instructed by the direct noti∣ces of things, but also by great experience in the matter of which you now inquire. But because I will not use any thing that shall look like an excuse, I will rather give Page  3 you such an account which you can easily reprove, then by declining your commands, seem more safe in my prudence, then open and communicative in my friendship to you. You first inquire how far a Dear and a perfect friendship is authoriz'd by the prin∣ciples of Christianity? To this I answer; That the word [Friendship] in the sense we commonly mean by it, is not so much as named in the New-Testament; and our Religion takes no notice of it. You think it strange; but read on before you spend so much as the beginning of a passion or a wonder upon it. There is mention of [Friendship with the world,] and it is said to be enmity with God; but the word is no where else na∣med, or to any other purpose in all the New-Testament. It speaks of Friends of∣ten; but by Friends are meant our ac∣quaintance, or our Kindred, the relatives of our family or our fortune, or our sect; something of society, or something of kindness there is in it; a tenderness of appellation and civility, a relation made Page  4 by gifts, or by duty, by services and sub∣jection; and I think, I have reason to be confident, that the word friend (speaking of humane entercourse) is no other-ways used in the Gospels or Epistles, or Acts of the Apostles: and the reason of it is, the word friend is of a large signification; and means all relations and societies, and whatsoever is not enemy; but by friend∣ships, I suppose you mean, the greatest love, and the greatest usefulness, and the most open communication, and the noblest suffer∣ings, and the most exemplar faithfulness, and the severest truth, and the heartiest counsel, and the greatest union of minds, of which brave men and women are capable. But then I must tell you that Christianity hath new christened it, and calls this Cha∣rity. The Christian knows no enemy he hath; that is, though persons may be in∣jurious to him, and unworthy in them∣selves, yet he knows none whom he is not first bound to forgive, which is indeed to make them on his part to be no enemies, that is, to make that the word enemy shall not be perfectly contrary to friend, it shall not be a relative term and signifie some∣thing on each hand, a relative and a corre∣lative; Page  5 and then he knows none whom he is not bound to love and pray for, to treat kindly and justly, liberally and obligingly. Christian Charity is Friendship to all the world; and when Friendships were the noblest things in the world, Charity was little, like the Sun drawn in at a chink, or his beams drawn into the centre of a Burning-Glass; but Christian charity is Friendship, expanded like the face of the Sun when it mounts above the Eastern hills: and I was strangely pleas'd when I saw something of this in CICERO; for I have been so push'd at by herds and flocks of People that follow any body that whi∣stles to them, or drives them to pasture, that I am grown afraid of any Truth that seems chargeable with singularity: but therefore I say, glad I was when I saw Laelius in Cicero discourse thus: Amicitia ex infinitate generis humani quam concili∣avit ipsa natura, contracta res est, & ad∣ducta in angustum; ut omnis charitas, aut inter duos, aut inter paucos jungeretur. Nature hath made friendships, and societies, relations and endearments; and by some∣thing or other we relate to all the World; there is enough in every man that is wil∣ling, Page  6 to make him become our friend; but when men contract friendship, they in∣close the Commons; and what Nature in∣tended should be every mans, we make proper to two or three. Friendship is like rivers and the strand of seas, and the air, common to all the World; but Ty∣rants, and evil customs, wars, and want of love have made them proper and pecu∣liar. But when Christianity came to re∣new our nature, and to restore our laws, and to increase her priviledges, and to make her aptness to become religion, then it was declared that our friendships were to be as universal as our conversation; that is, actual to all with whom we con∣verse, and potentially extended unto those with whom we did not. For he who was to treat his enemies with forgiveness and prayers, and love and beneficence was in∣deed to have no enemies, and to have all friends. So that to your question, how far a Dear and perfect friendship is authoriz'd by the principles of Christianity? The answer is ready and easie. It is warranted to extend to all Mankind; and the more we love, the Page  7 better we are, and the greater our friend∣ships are, the dearer we are to God; let them be as Dear, and let them be as per∣fect, and let them be as many as you can; there is no danger in it; only where the restraint begins, there begins our imper∣fection; it is not ill that you entertain brave friendships and worthy societies: it were well if you could love, and if you could benefit all Mankind; for I conceive that is the summe of all friendship. I confess this is not to be expected of us in this world; but as all our graces here are but imperfect, that is, at the best they are but tendencies to glory, so our friend∣ships are imperfect too, and but begin∣nings of a celestial friendship, by which we shall love every one as much as they can be loved. But then so we must here in our proportion; and indeed that is it that can make the difference; we must be friends to all: That is, apt to do good, loving them really, and doing to them all the be∣nefits which we can, and which they are capable of. The Friendship is equal to all the World, and of it self hath no differ∣ence; but is differenced only by accidents, Page  8 and by the capacity or incapacity of them that receive it. Nature and Religion are the bands of friendships; excellency and usefulness are its great indearments: society and neighbourhood, that is, the possibilities and the circumstances of converse are the determinations and actualities of it. Now when men either are unnatural, or irreli∣gious, they will not be friends; when they are neither excellent nor useful, they are not worthy to be friends; when they are strangers or unknown, they cannot be friends actually and practically; but yet, as any man hath any thing of the good, contrary to those evils, so he can have and must have his share of friendship. For thus the Sun is the eye of the World; and he is indifferent to the Negro, or the cold Russian, to them that dwell under the line, and them that stand near the Tropicks, the scalded Indian, or the poor boy that shakes at the foot of the Riphean hills; but the fluxures of the heaven and the earth, the conveniency of abode, and the approaches to the North or South respectively charge the emanations of his beams; not that they do not pass always from him, but that they are not equally received below, but by Page  9 periods and changes, by little inlets and reflections, they receive what they can; and some have only a dark day and a long night from him, snows and white cattel, a miserable life, and a perpetual harvest of Catarrhes and Consumptions, apoplexies and dead palsies; but some have splendid fires, and aromatick spices, rich wines, and well digested fruits, great wit and great courage; because they dwell in his eye, and look in his face, and are the Courtiers of the Sun, and wait upon him in his Chambers of the East; just so is it in friendships: some are worthy, and some are necessary; some dwell hard by and are fitted for converse; Nature joyns some to us, and Religion combines us with others; society and accidents, parity of fortune, and equal dispositions do actu∣ate our friendships: which of themselves and in their prime disposition are prepa∣red for all Mankind according as any one can receive them. We see this best ex∣emplified by two instances and expressi∣ons of friendships and charity: viz. Alms and Prayers; Every one that needs relief is equally the object of our charity; but though to all mankind in equal needs we Page  10 ought to be alike in charity; yet we sig∣nifie this severally and by limits, and di∣stinct measures: the poor man that is near me, he whom I meet, he whom I love, he whom I fancy, he who did me benefit, he who relates to my family, he rather then another, because my expressions be∣ing finite and narrow, and cannot extend to all in equal significations, must be ap∣propriate to those whose circumstances best fit me: and yet even to all I give my alms; to all the World that needs them; I pray for all mankind, I am grie∣ved at every sad story I hear; I am trou∣bled when I hear of a pretty Bride mur∣dered in her bride-chamber by an ambi∣tious and enrag'd Rival; I shed a tear when I am told that a brave King was mis∣understood, then slandered, then impri∣soned, and then put to death by evil men: and I can never read the story of the Parisian Massacre, or the Sicilian Ves∣pers, but my blood curdles, and I am dis∣order'd by two or three affections. A good man is a friend to all the World; and he is not truly charitable that does not wish well, and do good to all mankind in what he can; but though we must pray Page  11 for all men, yet we say special Litanies for brave Kings and holy Prelates, and the wise Guides of souls; for our Brethren and Relations, our Wives and Children. The effect of this consideration is, that the Universal friendship of which I speak, must be limited, because we are so: In those things where we stand next to im∣mensity and infinity, as in good wishes and prayers, and a readiness to benefit all man∣kind, in these our friendships must not be limited; but in other things which pass under our hand and eye, our voices and our material exchanges; our hands can reach no further but to our arms end, and our voices can but sound till the next air be quiet, and therefore they can have en∣tercourse but within the sphere of their own activity; our needs and our conver∣sations are served by a few, and they can∣not reach to all; where they can, they must; but where it is impossible, it cannot be necessary. It must therefore follow, that our friendships to mankind may ad∣mit variety as does our conversation; and as by nature we are made sociable to all, so we are friendly; but as all cannot actu∣ally Page  12 be of our society, so neither can all be admitted to a special, actual friendship; Of some entercourses all men are capable, but not of all; Men can pray for one ano∣ther, and abstain from doing injuries to all the world, and be desirous to do all mankind good, and love all men; Now this friendship we must pay to all because we can, but if we can do no more to all, we must shew our readiness to do more good to all by actually doing more good to all them to whom we can. To some we can, and therefore there are nearer friendships to some then to others, according as there are natural or civil nearnesses, relations and societies; and as I cannot express my friendships to all in equal measures and significations, that is, as I cannot do benefits to all alike: so neither am I tied to love all alike: for although there is much reason to love eve∣ry man; yet there are more reasons to love some than others; and if I must love because there is reason I should; then I must love more, where there is more rea∣son; and where there's a special affection and a great readiness to do good and to Page  13 delight in certain persons towards each other, there is that special charity and in∣dearment which Philosophy calls friend∣ship; but our Religion calls love or chari∣ty. Now if the inquiry be concerning this special friendship. 1. How it can be appropriate, that is, who to be chosen to it; 2. how far it may extend; that is, with what expressions signified; 3. how conducted? The answers will depend upon such considerations which will be neither useless nor unpleasant. 1. There may be a special friendship contracted for any special excellency what∣soever; because friendships are nothing but love and society mixt together; that is, a conversing with them whom we love; now for whatsoever we can love any one, for that we can be his friend; and since every excellency is a degree of amability, every such worthiness is a just and proper mo∣tive of friendship, or loving conversation. But yet in these things there is an order and proportion. Therefore 2. A good man is the best friend, and therefore soonest to be chosen, longer to Page  14 be retain'd; and indeed never to be parted with, unless he cease to be that for which he was chosen.    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉,  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.   Where vertue dwells there friendship make, But evil neighbourhoods forsake.   But although vertue alone is the worthiest cause of amability, and can weigh down any one consideration; and therefore to a man that is vertuous every man ought to be a friend; yet I do not mean the se∣vere, and philosophical excellencies of some morose persons who are indeed wise unto themselves, and exemplar to others: by vertue here I do not mean justice and temperance, charity and devotion; for these I am to love the man, but friendship is something more then that: Friendship is the nearest love and the nearest society of which the persons are capable: Now ju∣stice is a good entercourse for Merchants, •s all men are that buy and sell; and tem∣perance Page  15 makes a Man good company, and helps to make a wise man; but a perfect friendship requires something else, these must be in him that is chosen to be my friend; but for these I do not make him my privado; that is, my special and pecu∣liar friend: but if he be a good man, then he is properly fitted to be my correlative in the noblest combination. And for this we have the best warrant in the world: For a just man scarcely will a man die; the Syriac interpreter reads it, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉for an unjust man scarcely will a man die; that is, a wicked man is at no hand fit to receive the expression of the greatest friendship; but all the Greek co∣pies that ever I saw, or read of, read it as we do; for a righteous man or a just man, that is, justice and righteousness is not the nearest indearment of friendship; but for a good man some will even dare to die: that is, for a man that is sweetly disposed, ready to do acts of goodness and to ob∣lige others, to do things useful and pro∣fitable, for a loving man, a beneficent, bountiful man, one who delights in doing good to his friend, such a man may have Page  16 the highest friendship; he may have a friend that will die for him. And this is the meaning of Laelius: Vertue may be despised, so may Learning and Nobility; at una est amicitia in rebus humanis de cu∣jus utilitate omnes consentiunt: only friend∣ship is that thing, which because all know to be useful and profitable, no man can despise; that is 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, or 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, goodness or beneficence makes friendships. For if he be a good man he will love where he is beloved, and that's the first tie of friendship.  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. That was the commendation of the bra∣vest friendship in Theocritus,  They lov'd each other with a love That did in all things equal prove.   〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.   The World was under Saturn's reign When he that lov'd was lov'd again.  Page  17 For it is impossible this nearness of friend∣ship can be where there is not mutual love; but this is secured if I choose a good man; for he that is apt enough to begin alone, will never be behind in the relation and correspondency; and therefore I like the Gentiles Litany well,   〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.   Let God give friends to me for my re∣ward, Who shall my love with equal love re∣gard; Happy are they, who when they give their heart Find such as in exchange their own im∣part.   But there is more in it than this felicity amounts to. For 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉the good man is a profitable, useful person, and that's the band of an effective friendship. For I do not think that friendships are Metaphysical nothings, created for con∣templation, Page  18 or that Men or Women should stare upon each others faces, and make dialogues of news and prettinesses, and look babies in one anothers eyes. Friendship is the allay of our sorrows, the ease of our passions, the discharge of our oppressions, the sanctuary to our ca∣lamities, the counsellor of our doubts, the clarity of our minds, the emission of our thoughts, the exercise and improve∣ment of what we meditate: And although I love my friend because he is worthy, yet he is not worthy if he can do no good. I do not speak of accidental hindrances and misfortunes by which the bravest man may become unable to help his Child; but of the natural and artificial capacities of the man. He only is fit to be chosen for a friend, who can do those offices for which friendship is excellent. For (mi∣stake not) no man can be loved for him∣self; our perfections in this World can∣not reach so high; it is well if we would love God at that rate, and I very much fear, that if God did us no good, we might admire his Beauties, but we should have but a small proportion of love to∣wards him; and therefore it is, that God Page  19 to endear the obedience, that is, the love of his servants, signifies what benefits he gives us, what great good things he does for us. I am the Lord God that brought thee out of the land of Egypt: and does Job serve God for nought? and he that comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder: all his other greatnesses are objects of fear and wonder, it is his good∣ness that makes him lovely: and so it is in friendships. He only is fit to be chosen for a friend who can give counsel, or de∣fend my cause, or guide me right, or re∣lieve my need, or can and will, when I need it, do me good: only this I add: into the heaps of doing good, I will reck∣on [loving me] for it is a pleasure to be beloved, but when his love signifies no∣thing but kissing my cheek, or talking kindly, and can go no further, it is a pro∣stitution of the bravery of friendship to spend it upon impertinent people who are (it may be) loads to their families, but can never ease my loads: but my friend is a worthy person when he can become to me instead of God, a guide or a sup∣port, an eye, or a hand; a staff, or a rule: There must be in friendship some∣thing Page  20 to distinguish it from a Companion, and a Country man, from a School-fellow or a Gossip, from a Sweet-heart or a Fel∣low-traveller: Friendship may look in at any one of these doors, but it stays not any where till it come to be the best thing in the world: and when we consider that one man is not better than another, neither towards God nor towards Man, but by doing better and braver things, we shall also see, that that which is most beneficent is also most excellent; and therefore those friendships must needs be most perfect, where the friends can be most useful. For men cannot be useful but by worthinesses in the several instances: a fool cannot be relyed upon for counsel, nor a vitious per∣son for the advantages of vertue, nor a begger for relief, nor a stranger for con∣duct, nor a tatler to keep a secret, nor a pittiless person trusted with my complaint, nor a covetous man with my childs for∣tune, nor a false person without a witness, nor a suspicious person with a private de∣sign; nor him that I fear with the trea∣sures of my love: But he that is wise and vertuous, rich and at hand, close and mer∣ciful, free of his money and tenacious of a Page  21 secret, open and ingenuous, true and ho∣nest, is of himself an excellent man; and therefore fit to be loved; and he can do good to me in all capacities where I can need him, and therefore is fit to be a friend. I confess we are forced in our friendships to abate some of these ingre∣dients; but full measures of friendship, would have full measures of worthiness; and according as any defect is in the foun∣dation; in the relation also there may be imperfection: and indeed I shall not blame the friendship so it be worthy, though it be not perfect; not only because friendship is charity, which cannot be perfect here, but because there is not in the World a perfect cause of perfect friendship. If you can suspect that this discourse can suppose friendship to be mercenary, and to be defective in the greatest worthiness of it, which is to love our friend for our friends sake, I shall easily be able to de∣fend my self; because I speak of the ele∣ction and reasons of choosing friends: after he is chosen do as nobly as you talk, and love as purely as you dream, and let your conversation be as metaphysical as Page  22 your discourse, and proceed in this me∣thod, till you be confuted by experience; yet till then, the case is otherwise when we speak of choosing one to be my friend: He is not my friend till I have chosen him, or loved him; and if any man enquires whom he shall choose or whom he should love, I suppose it ought not to be answer∣ed, that we should love him who hath least amability; that we should choose him who hath least reason to be chosen: But if it be answered, he is to be chosen to be my friend who is most worthy in himself, not he that can do most good to me; I say, here is a distinction but no difference; for he is most worthy in himself who can do most good; and if he can love me too, that is, if he will do me all the good he can, that I need, then he is my friend and he deserves it. And it is impossible from a friend to separate a will to do me good: and therefore I do not choose well, if I choose one that hath not power; for if it may consist with the nobleness of friend∣ship to desire that my friend be ready to do me benefit or support, it is not sense to say, it is ignoble to desire he should really do it when I need; and if it were Page  23 not for pleasure or profit, we might as well be without a friend as have him. Among all the pleasures and profits, the sensual pleasure and the matter of money are the lowest and the least; and therefore although they may sometimes be used in friendship, and so not wholly excluded from the consideration of him that is to choose, yet of all things they are to be the least regarded.    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.   When fortune frowns upon a Man, A friend does more than money can.    For there are besides these, many profits and many pleasures; and because these on∣ly are sordid, all the other are noble and fair, and the expectations of them no dis∣paragements to the best friendships. For can any wise or good man be angry if I say, I choose this man to be my friend, because he is able to give me counsel, to restrain my wandrings, to comfort me in my sorrows; he is pleasant to me in pri∣vate, Page  24 and useful in publick; he will make my joys double, and divide my grief be∣tween himself and me? For what else should I choose; For being a fool, and useless; for a pretty face or a smooth chin? I confess it is possible to be a friend to one that is ignorant, and pitiable, hand∣some and good for nothing, that eats well, and drinks deep, but he cannot be a friend to me; and I love him with a fondness or a pity, but it cannot be a noble friend∣ship.  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.   said Menander. By Wine and mirth and every days de∣light We choose our friends, to whom we think we might Our Souls intrust; but fools are they that lend Their bosom to the shadow of a friend.  Page  25〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. Plutarch calls such friendships, the Idols and Images of friendship. True and brave friendships are between worthy persons; and there is in Mankind no degree of worthiness, but is also a degree of usefulness, and by e∣very thing by which a man is excellent, I may be profited: and because those are the bravest friends which can best serve the ends of friendships, either we must suppose that friendships are not the great∣est comforts in the World, or else we must say, he chooses his friend best, that chooses such a one by whom he can receive the greatest comforts and assistances. 3. This being the measure of all friend∣ships; they all partake of excellency, ac∣cording as they are fitted to this measure: a friend may be counselled well enough though his friend be not the wisest man in the world, and he may be pleased in his society though he be not the best na∣tured man in the world; but still it must be, that something excellent is, or is ap∣prehended, or else it can be no worthy friendship; because the choice is impru∣dent Page  26 and foolish. Choose for your friend him that is wise and good, and secret and just, ingenuous and honest; and in those things which have a latitude, use your own liberty; but in such things which con∣sist in an indivisible point, make no abate∣ments; That is, you must not choose him to be your friend that is not honest and secret, just and true to a tittle; but if he be wise at all, and useful in any degree, and as good as you can have him, you need not be ashamed to own your friend∣ships; though sometimes you may be a∣shamed of some imperfections of your friend. 4. But if you yet enquire further, whe∣ther fancy may be an ingredient in your choice? I answer, that fancy may minister to this as to all other actions in which there is a liberty and variety; and we shall find that there may be peculiarities and little partialities, a friendship, improperly so called, entring upon accounts of an in∣nocent passion and a pleas'd fancy; even our Blessed Saviour himself loved Saint John and Lazarus by a special love, which was signified by special treatments; and Page  27 of the young man that spake well and wise∣ly to Christ, it is affirmed, Jesus loved him: that is, he fancied the man, and his soul had a certain cognation and similitude of temper and inclination. For in all things where there is a latitude, every faculty will endeavour to be pleased, and sometimes the meanest persons in a house have a festival; even sympathies and na∣tural inclinations to some persons, and a conformity of humours, and proportion∣able loves, and the beauty of the face, and a witty answer may first strike the flint and kindle a spark, which if it falls upon tender and compliant natures may grow into a flame; but this will never be main∣tained at the rate of friendship, unless it be fed by pure materials, by worthinesses which are the food of friendship: where these are not, Men and Women may be pleased with one anothers company, and lye under the same roof, and make them∣selves companions of equal prosperities, and humour their friend; but if you call this friendship, you give a sacred name to humour or fancy; for there is a Plato∣nick friendship as well as a Platonick love; but they being but the Images of more Page  28 noble bodies are but like tinsel dressings, which will shew bravely by candle-light, and do excellently in a mask, but are not fit for conversation, and the material en∣tercourses of our life. These are the pret∣tinesses of prosperity and good-natured wit; but when we speak of friendship, which is the best thing in the World (for it is love and beneficence; it is charity that is fitted for society) we cannot sup∣pose a brave pile should be built up with nothing; and they that build Castles in the air, and look upon friendship, as upon a fine Romance, a thing that pleases the fan∣cy, but is good for nothing else, will do well when they are asleep, or when they are come to Elysium; and for ought I know in the mean time may be as much in love with Mandana in the Grand Cyrus, as with the Infanta of Spain, or any of the most perfect beauties and real excellencies of the world: and by dreaming of perfect and abstracted friendships, make them so immaterial that they perish in the handling and become good for nothing. But I know not whither I was going; I did only mean to say that because friend∣ship Page  29 is that by which the world is most blessed and receives most good, it ought to be chosen amongst the worthiest per∣sons, that is, amongst those that can do greatest benefit to each other; and though in equal worthiness I may chuse by my eye, or ear, that is, into the consideration of the essential I may take in also the acci∣dental and extrinsick worthinesses; yet I ought to give every one their just value; when the internal beauties are equal, these shall help to weigh down the scale, and I will love a worthy friend that can delight me as well as profit me, rather than him who cannot delight me at all, and profit me no more; but yet I will not weigh the gayest flowers, or the wings of butter∣flies against wheat; but when I am to chuse wheat, I may take that which looks the brightest: I had rather see Thyme and Roses, Marjoram and July-flowers that are fair and sweet and medicinal, than the prettiest Tulips that are good for nothing: And my Sheep and Kine are better servants than Race-horses and Gray-hounds: And I shall rather furnish my Study with Plu∣tarch and Cicero, with Livy and Polybius, than with Cassandra and Ibrahim Bassa; Page  30 and if I do give an hour to these for di∣vertisement or pleasure, yet I will dwell with them that can instruct me, and make me wise and eloquent, severe and useful to my self and others. I end this with the saying of Laelius in Cicero: Amicitia non debet consequi utilitatem, sed amicitiam uti∣litas. When I chuse my friend, I will not stay till I have received a kindness; but I will chuse such an one that can do me many if I need them: But I mean such kindnes∣ses which make me wiser, and which make me better; that is, I will when I chuse my friend, chuse him that is the bravest, the worthiest and the most excellent person: and then your first Question is soon an∣swered; to love such a person and to con∣tract such friendships is just so authorized by the principles of Christianity, as it is warranted to love wisdom and vertue, goodness and beneficence, and all the im∣presses of God upon the spirits of brave men. 2. The next inquiry is how far it may extend? That is, by what expressions it may be signified? I find that David and Jonathan loved at a strange rate; they Page  31 were both good men; though it happened that Jonathan was on the obliging side; but here the expressions were; Jonathan watched for Davids good; told him of his danger, and helped him to escape; took part with Davids innocence against his Fathers malice and injustice; and be∣yond all this, did it to his own prejudice; and they two stood like two feet support∣ing one body; though Jonathan knew that David would prove like the foot of a Wrestler, and would supplant him, not by any unworthy or unfriendly action, but it was from God; and he gave him his hand to set him upon his own Throne. We find his parallels in the Gentile sto∣ries: young Athenodorus having divided the estate with his Brother Xenon; divided it again when Xenon had spent his own share; and Lucullus would not take the Consulship till his younger brother had first enjoyed it for a year; but Pollux di∣vided with Castor his immortality; and you know who offer'd himself to death be∣ing pledg for his friend; and his friend by performing his word rescued him as brave∣ly: and when we find in Scripture that Page  32for a good man some will even dare to die; and that Aquila and Priscilla laid their necks down for S. Paul; and the Galati∣ans would have given him their very eyes, that is, every thing that was most dear to them, and some others were near unto death for his sake; and that it is a precept of Christian charity, to lay down our lives for our brethren, that is, those who were combined in a cause of Religion, who were united with the same hopes, and im∣parted to each other ready assistances, and grew dear by common sufferings, we need enquire no further for the expressions of friendships: Greater love than this hath no man, than that he lay down his life for his friends; and this we are oblig'd to do in some Cases for all Christians; and there∣fore we may do it for those who are to us in this present and imperfect state of things, that which all the good Men and Women in the World shall be in Heaven, that is, in the state of perfect friendships. This is the biggest; but then it includes and can suppose all the rest; and if this may be done for all, and in some cases must for any one of the multitude, we need not scruple whether we may do it for those Page  33 who are better than a multitude. But as for the thing it self, it is not easily and lightly to be done; and a Man must not die for humour, nor expend so great a Jewel for a trifle: 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉: said Philo; we will hardly die when it is for nothing, when no good, no worthy end is served, and become a Sacrifice to redeem a foot boy. But we may not give our life to redeem another: unless 1. The party for whom we die be a worthy and an useful person; better for the publick, or better for Religion, and more useful to others than my self. Thus Ribischius the German died bravely when he became a Sacrifice for his Master, Mau∣rice Duke of Saxony; Covering his Ma∣sters body with his own, that he might escape the fury of the Turkish Souldiers. Succurram perituro, sed ut ipse non peream, nisi si futurus ero magni hominis, aut magnae rei merces, said Seneca. I will help a dy∣ing person if I can; but I will not die my self for him, unless by my death I save a brave man, or become the price of a great thing; that is, I will die for a Prince, for the republick, or to save an Army, as Page  34David expos'd himself to combat with the Philistin for the redemption of the host of Israel: and in this sense, that is true; Praestat ut pereat unus, quam Vnitas, bet∣ter that one perish than a multitude. 2. A man dies bravely when he gives his tem∣poral life to save the soul of any single per∣son in the Christian world. It is a worthy exchange, and the glorification of that love by which Christ gave his life for eve∣ry soul. Thus he that reproves an erring Prince wisely and necessarily, he that af∣firms a fundamental truth, or stands up for the glory of the Divine attributes, though he die for it, becomes a worthy sacrifice. 3. These are duty, but it may be heroick and full of Christian bravery, to give my life to rescue a noble and a brave friend; though I my self be as worthy a man as he; because the preference of him is an act of humility in me; and of friendship towards him; Humility and Charity ma∣king a pious difference, where art and na∣ture have made all equal. Some have fancied other measures of treating our friends. One sort of men say that we are to expect that our friends Page  35 should value us as we value our selves: which if it were to be admitted, will re∣quire that we make no friendship with a proud man; and so far indeed were well; but then this proportion does exclude some humble men who are most to be va∣lued, and the rather because they under∣value themselves. Others say that a friend is to value his friend as much as his friend values him; but neither is this well or safe, wise or sufficient; for it makes friendship a meer bargain, and is something like the Coun∣try weddings in some places where I have been; where the bridegroom and the bride must meet in the half way, and if they fail a step, they retire and break the match: It is not good to make a reckon∣ing in friendship; that's merchandise, or it may be gratitude, but not noble friend∣ship; in which each part strives to out do the other in significations of an excellent love: And amongst true friends there is no fear of losing any thing. But that which amongst the old Philo∣sophers comes nearest to the right, is that Page  36 we love our friends as we love our selves, If they had meant it as our Blessed Saviour did, of that general friendship by which we are to love all Mankind, it had been perfect and well; or if they had meant it of the inward affection, or of outward justice; but because they meant it of the most excellent friendships, and of the out∣ward significations of it, it cannot be suf∣ficient: for a friend may and must some∣times do more for his friend than he would do for himself. Some men will perish be∣fore they will beg or petition for them∣selves to some certain persons; but they account it noble to do it for their friend, and they will want rather than their friend shall want; and they will be more earnest in praise or dispraise respectively for their friend than for themselves. And indeed I account that one of the greatest demon∣strations of real friendship, that a friend can really endeavour to have his friend advanced in honour, in reputation, in the opinion of wit or learning before himself.    *Aurum & opes, & rura frequens donabit amicus: Qui velit ingenio cedere rarus erit.  Page  37Sed tibi tantus inest veteris respectus amici, Carior ut me sit quam tua fama tibi.   Lands, gold and trifles many give or lend; But he that stoops in fame is a rare friend; In friendships orb thou art the bright∣est star, Before thy fame mine thou preferrest far.   But then he pleased to think that there∣fore I so highly value this signification of friendship, because I so highly value hu∣mility. Humility and Charity are the two greatest graces in the World; and these are the greatest ingredients which con∣stitute friendship and express it. But there needs no other measures of friendship, but that it may be as great as you can express it; beyond death it cannot go, to death it may, when the cause is reasonable and just, charitable and reli∣gious: and yet if there be any thing great∣er than to suffer death (and pain and shame to some are more insufferable) a true and Page  38 noble friendship shrinks not at the greatest trials. And yet there is a limit even to friend∣ship. It must be as great as our friend fairly needs in all things where we are not tied up by a former duty, to God, to our selves, or some pre-obliging relative. When Pollux heard some body whisper a reproach against his Brother Castor, he killed the slanderer with his fist: that was a zeal which his friendship could not warrant. Nulla est excusatio si amici cau∣sâ peccaveris, said Cicero. No friendship can excuse a sin: And this the braver Ro∣mans instanced in the matter of duty to their Country. It is not lawful to fight on our friends part against our Prince or Country; and therefore when Caius Blo∣sius of Cuma in the sedition of Gracchus appeared against his Country, when he was taken he answered, That he loved Tiberius Gracchus so dearly, that he thought fit to follow him whithersoever he led; and begg'd pardon upon that ac∣count. They who were his Judges were so noble, that though they knew it no fair excuse: yet for the honour of friendship Page  39 they did not directly reject his motion: but put him to death, because he did not follow, but led on Gracchus, and brought his friend into the snare: For so they pre∣served the honours of friendship on either hand, by neither suffering it to be sullied by a foul excuse, nor yet rejected in any fair pretence. A man may not be perju∣red for his friend. I remember to have read in the History of the Low-countries, that Grimston and Redhead, when Bergen∣apzoom was besieged by the Duke of Par∣ma, acted for the interest of the Queen of Englands Forces a notable design; but be∣ing suspected and put for their acquittance to take the Sacrament of the Altar, they dissembled their persons, and their inter∣est, their design and their religion, and did for the Queens service (as one wittily wrote to her) give not only their bodies but their souls, and so deserved a reward greater than she could pay them: I cannot say this is a thing greater than a friend∣ship can require, for it is not great at all, but a great villany, which hath no name, and no order in worthy entercourses; and no obligation to a friend can reach as high as our duty to God: And he that does Page  40 a base thing in zeal for his friend, burns the golden thred that ties their hearts to∣gether; it is a conspiracy, but no longer friendship. And when Cato lent his Wife to Hortensius, and Socrates lent his to a merry Greek, they could not amongst wise persons obtain so much as the fame of being worthy friends, neither could those great Names legitimate an unworthy acti∣on under the most plausible title. It is certain that amongst friends their estates are common; that is, by whatso∣ever I can rescue my friend from calamity, I am to serve him, or not to call him friend; there is a great latitude in this, and it is to be restrained by no prudence, but when there is on the other side a great necessity neither vicious nor avoidable: A man may chuse whether he will or no; and he does not sin in not doing it, unless he have bound himself to it: But certainly friendship is the greatest band in the world, and if he have professed a great friendship, he hath a very great obligation to do that and more; and he can no ways be disob∣liged but by the care of his Natural rela∣tions. Page  41I said, [Friendship is the greatest bond in the world,] and I had reason for it, for it is all the bands that this world hath; and there is no society, and there is no rela∣tion that is worthy, but it is made so by the communications of friendship, and by partaking some of its excellencies. For friendship is a transcendent, and signifies as much as Vnity can mean, and every consent, and every pleasure, and every be∣nefit, and every society is the Mother or the Daughter of friendship. Some friend∣ships are made by nature, some by contract, some by interest, and some by souls. And in proportion to these ways of Uniting, so the friendships are greater or less, ver∣tuous or natural, profitable or holy, or all this together. Nature makes excellent friendships, of which we observe some∣thing in social parts; growing better in each others neighbourhood than where they stand singly: And in animals it is more notorious, whose friendships extend so far as to herd and dwell together, to play, and feed, to defend and fight for one another, and to cry in absence, and to re∣joyce in one anothers presence. But these Page  42 friendships have other names less noble, they are sympathy, or they are instinct. But if to this natural friendship there be reason superadded, something will come in upon the stock of reason which will en∣noble it; but because no Rivers can rise higher than Fountains, reason shall draw out all the dispositions which are in Na∣ture and establish them into friendships, but they cannot surmount the communica∣tions of Nature; Nature can make no friendships greater than her own excellen∣cies. Nature is the way of contracting necessary friendships; that is, by nature such friendships are contracted without which we cannot live, and be educated, or be well, or be at all. In this scene, that of Parents and Children is the great∣est, which indeed is begun in nature, but is actuated by society and mutual endear∣ments. For Parents love their Children because they love themselves, Children being but like emissions of water, symbo∣lical, or indeed the same with the foun∣tain; and they in their posterity see the images and instruments of a civil immor∣tality; but if Parents and Children do not live together, we see their friendships and Page  43 their loves are much abated, and support∣ed only by fame and duty, by customs and religion, which to nature are but artifi∣cial pillars, and make this friendship to be complicated, and to pass from its own kind to another. That of Children to their Parents is not properly friendship, but gratitude and interest, and religion, and whatever can supervene of the nature of friendship comes in upon another ac∣count; upon society and worthiness and choice. This relation on either hand makes great Dearnesses: But it hath special and proper significations of it, and there is a special duty incumbent on each other re∣spectively. This friendship and social re∣lation is not equal, and there is too much authority on one side, and too much fear on the other to make equal friendships; and therefore although this is one of the kinds of friendship, that is of a social and relative love and conversation, yet in the more proper use of the word; [Friend∣ship] does do some things which Father and Son do not; I instance in the free and open communicating counsels, and the Page  44 evenness and pleasantness of conversation; and consequently the significations of the paternal and filial love as they are divers in themselves and unequal, and therefore another kind of friendship than we mean in our inquiry; so they are such a duty Which no other friendship can annul: be∣cause their mutual duty is bound upon them by religion long before any other friendships can be contracted; and there∣fore having first possession must abide for ever. The duty and love to Parents must not yield to religion, much less to any new friendships: and our Parents are to be preferred before the Corban; and are at no hand to be laid aside but when they en∣gage against God: That is, in the rights which this relation and kind of friendship challenges as its propriety, it is supreme and cannot give place to any other friend∣ships; till the Father gives his right away, and God or the Laws consent to it; as in the case of marriage, emancipation, and adoption to another family: in which cases though love and gratitude are still obli∣ging, yet the societies and duties of rela∣tion are very much altered, which in the proper and best friendships can never be Page  45 at all. But then this also is true: that the social relations of Parents and Children not having in them all the capacities of a proper friendship, cannot challenge all the significations of it: that is, it is no pre∣judice to the duty I owe there, to pay all the dearnesses which are due here, and to friends there are some things due which the other cannot challenge: I mean, my se∣cret, and my equal conversation, and the pleasures and interests of these, and the consequents of all. Next to this is the society and dearness of Brothers and Sisters: which usually is very great amongst worthy persons; but if it be considered what it is in it self, it is but very little; there is very often a likeness of natural temper, and there is a social life under the same roof, and they are commanded to love one another, and they are equals in many instances, and are endeared by conversation when it is merry and pleasant, innocent and simple, without art and without design. But Brothers pass not into noble friendships upon the stock of that relation: they have fair dis∣positions and advantages, and are more Page  46 easie and ready to ferment into the great∣est dearnesses, if all things else be answer∣able. Nature disposes them well towards it, but in this inquiry if we ask what duty is passed upon a Brother to a Brother even for being so? I answer, that religion and our parents and God and the laws appoint what measures they please; but nature passes but very little, and friendship less; and this we see apparently in those Bro∣thers who live asunder, and contract new relations, and dwell in other societies: There is no love, no friendship without the entercourse of conversation: Friend∣ships indeed may last longer than our a∣bode together, but they were first con∣tracted by it, and established by pleasure and benefit, and unless it be the best kind of friendship (which that of Brothers in that meer capacity is not) it dies when it wants the proper nutriment and support: and to this purpose is that which was spo∣ken by Solomon: [better is a neih∣bour that is near,*than a Brother that is far off:] that is, although ordinarily, Brothers are first possessed of the entries and fancies of friendship, be∣cause they are of the first societies and Page  47 conversations, yet when that ceases and the Brother goes away, so that he does no advantage, no benefit of entercourse; the neighbour that dwells by me, with whom if I converse at all, either he is my enemy and does, and receives evil; or if we con∣verse in worthinesses and benefit and plea∣sant communication, he is better in the laws and measures of friendship than my distant Brother. And it is observable that [Brother] is indeed a word of friendship and charity and of mutual endearment, and so is a title of the bravest society; yet in all the Scripture there are no precepts given of any duty and comport which Brothers, that is, the descendents of the same parents are to have one towards ano∣ther in that capacity, and it is not because their nearness is such that they need none: For Parents and children are nearer, and yet need tables of duty to be described; and for Brothers, certainly they need it infinitely if there be any peculiar duty; Cain and Abel are the great probation of that, and you know who said,   Fratrum quoque gratia rara est:    Page  48It is not often you shall see Two Brothers live in amity.   But the Scripture which often describes the duty of Parents and Children, never describes the duty of Brothers; except where by Brethren are meant all that part of mankind who are tied to us by any vi∣cinity and indearment of religion or coun∣try, of profession and family, of contract or society, of love and the noblest friend∣ships; the meaning is, that though fra∣ternity alone be the endearment of some degrees of friendship, without choice and without excellency; yet the relation it self is not friendship, and does not natu∣rally infer it, and that which is procured by it, is but limited and little; and though it may pass into it, as other conversations may, yet the friendship is accidental to it; and enters upon other accounts, as it does between strangers; with this only diffe∣rence that Brotherhood does oftentimes assist the valuation of those excellencies for which we entertain our friendships. Fra∣ternity is the opportunity and preliminary disposition to friendship, and no more. Page  49 For if my brother be a fool or a vitious person, the love to which nature and our first conversation disposes me, does not end in friendship, but in pity and fair pro∣visions, and assistances; which is a demon∣stration that Brotherhood is but the incli∣nation and address to friendship: and though I will love a worthy Brother more than a worthy stranger; if the worthiness be equal, because the relation is something, and being put into the scales against an equal worthiness must needs turn the bal∣lance, as every grain will do in an even weight; yet when the relation is all the worthiness that is pretended, it cannot stand in competition with a friend: for though a friend-Brother is better than a friend-stranger, where the friend is equal, but the Brother is not: yet a Brother is not better than a friend; but as Solomons expression is [there is a friend that is bet∣ter than a Brother,] and to be born of the same parents is so accidental and extrin∣sick to a mans pleasure or worthiness, or spiritual advantages, that though it be very pleasing and useful that a Brother should be a friend, yet it is no great addition to a friend that he also is a Brother: there is Page  50 something in it, but not much. But in short, the case is thus. The first begin∣nings of friendship serve the necessities; but choice and worthiness are the excellen∣cies of its endearment and its bravery; and between a Brother that is no friend, and a friend that is no Brother, there is the same difference as between the dispo∣sition, and the act or habit: a Brother if he be worthy is the readiest and the near∣est to be a friend, but till he be so, he is but the twi-light of the day, and but the blossome to the fairest fruit of Paradise. A Brother does not always make a friend, but a friend ever makes a Brother and more: And although nature sometimes finds the tree, yet friendship engraves the Image; the first relation places him in the Garden, but friendship sets it in the Tem∣ple, and then only it is venerable and sa∣cred: and so is Brotherhood when it hath the soul of friendship. So that if it be asked which are most to be valued, Brothers or friends; the an∣swer is very easie; Brotherhood is or may be one of the kinds of friendship, and from thence only hath its value, and Page  51 therefore if it be compared with a greater friendship must give place: But then it is not to be asked which is to be preferred, a Brother or a Friend, but which is the better friend; Memnon or my Brother? For if my Brother says I ought to love him best, then he ought to love me best; valiant * if he does, then there is a great friendship, and he possi∣bly is to be preferred; if he can be that friend which he pretends to be, that is, if he be equally worthy: but if he says, I must love him only because he is my Brother, whether he loves me or no, he is ridiculous; and it will be a strange relation which hath no correspondent: but suppose it, and add this also, that I am equally his Brother as he is mine, and then he also must love me whether I love him or no; and if he does not, he says, I must love him though he be my Enemy; and so I must; but I must not love my E∣nemy though he be my Brother more then I love my Friend; and at last if he does love me for being his Brother, I confess that this love deserves love again; but Page  52 then I consider, that he loves me upon an incompetent reason: for he that loves me only because I am his Brother, loves me for that which is no worthiness, and I must love him as much as that comes to, and for as little reason; unless this be added, that he loves me first: but whether choice and union of souls, and worthiness of man∣ners, and greatness of understanding, and usefulness of conversation, and the bene∣fits of Counsel, and all those endearments which make our lives pleasant and our per∣sons Dear, are not better and greater rea∣sons of love and Dearness than to be born of the same flesh, I think amongst wise persons needs no great inquiry. For fra∣ternity is but a Cognation of bodies, but friendship is an Union of souls which are confederated by more noble ligatures. My Brother, if he be no more, shall have my hand to help him, but unless he be my friend too, he cannot challenge my heart: and if his being my friend be the greater nearness, then friend is more than Brother, and I suppose no man doubts but that Da∣vid lov'd Jonathan far more than he lov'd his Brother Eliah. Page  53One inquiry more there may be in this affair, and that is, whether a friend may be more than a Husband or Wife; To which I answer, that it can never be rea∣sonable or just, prudent or lawful: but the reason is, because Marriage is the Queen of friendships, in which there is a communication of all that can be commu∣nicated by friendship: and it being made sacred by vows and love, by bodies and souls, by interest and custome, by religion and by laws, by common Counsels, and common fortunes; it is the principal in the kind of friendship, and the measure of all the rest: And there is no abatement to this consideration, but that there may be some allay in this as in other letter friend∣ships by the incapacity of the persons: if I have not chosen my friend wisely or fortunately, he cannot be the correlative in the best Union; but then the friend lives as the soul does after death, it is in the state of separation, in which the soul strangely loves the body and longs to be reunited, but the body is an useless trunk and can do no ministeries to the soul; which therefore prays to have the body Page  54 reformed and restored and made a brave and a fit companion: so must these best friends, when one is useless or unapt to the braveries of the princely friendship, they must love ever, and pray ever, and long till the other be perfected and made fit; in this case there wants only the bo∣dy, but the soul is still a relative and must be so for ever. A Husband and a Wife are the best friends, but they cannot always signifie all that to each other which their friendships would; as the Sun shines not upon a Val∣ley which sends up a thick vapour to cover his face; and though his beams are eternal, yet the emission is intercepted by the intervening cloud. But however all friendships are but parts of this; a man must leave Father and Mother and cleave to his Wife, that is [the dearest thing in Nature is not comparable to the dearest thing of friendship:] and I think this is argu∣ment sufficient to prove friendship to be the greatest band in the world; Add to this, that other friendships are parts of this, they are marriages too, less indeed than the other, because they cannot, must Page  55 not be all that endearment which the other is; yet that being the principal, is the measure of the rest, and are all to be ho∣noured by like dignities, and measured by the same rules, and conducted by their portion of the same Laws: But as friend∣ships are Marriages of the soul, and of fortunes and interests, and counsels; so they are brotherhoods too; and I often think of the excellencies of friendships in the words of David, who certainly was the best friend in the World [Ecce quam bonum & quam jucundum fratres habitare in unum:] It is good and it is pleasant that Brethren should live like friends, that is, they who are any ways relative, and who are any ways social and confederate should also dwell in Unity and loving so∣ciety, for that is the meaning of the word [Brother] in Scripture [It was my Bro∣ther Jonathan] said David; such Bro∣thers contracting such friendships are the beauties of society, and the pleasure of life, and the festivity of minds: and what∣soever can be spoken of love, which is God's eldest daughter, can be said of ver∣tuous friendships; and though Carneades made an eloquent Oration at Rome against Page  56 justice, and yet never saw a Panegyrick of malice, or ever read that any man was witty against friendship. Indeed it is pro∣bable that some men, finding themselves by the peculiarities of friendship excluded from the participation of those beauties of society which enamel and adorn the wise and the vertuous, might suppose them∣selves to have reason to speak the evil words of envy and detraction; I wonder not that all those unhappy souls which shall find heaven gates shut against them, will think they have reason to murmur and blaspheme: The similitude is apt enough, for that is the region of friendship, and love is the light of that glorious Countrey, but so bright that it needs no Sun: Here we have fine and bright rayes of that Ce∣lestial flame, and though to all Mankind the light of it is in some measure to be ex∣tended, like the treasures of light dwelling in the South, yet a little do illustrate and beautifie the North, yet some live under the line, and the beams of friendship in that position are imminent and perpendi∣cular. I know but one thing more in which Page  57 the Communications of friendship can be restrained; and that is, in Friends and Enemies: Amicus amici, amicus meus non est: My friends friend is not always my friend; nor his enemy mine; for if my friend quarrel with a third person with whom he hath had no friendships, upon the account of interest; if that third per∣son be my friend, the nobleness of our friendships despises such a quarrel; and what may be reasonable in him, would be ignoble in me; sometimes it may be o∣therwise, and friends may marry one ano∣thers loves and hatreds, but it is by chance if it can be just, and therefore because it is not always right it cannot be ever neces∣sary. In all things else, let friendships be as high and expressive till they become an Union, or that friends like the Molionidae be so the same that the flames of their dead bodies make but one Pyramis; no charity can be reproved; and such friend∣ships which are more than shadows, are nothing else but the rayes of that glorious grace drawn into one centre, and made more active by the Union; and the pro∣per Page  58 significations are well represented in the old Hieroglyphick, by which the an∣cients depicted friendship: In the beau∣ties and strength of a young man, bare∣headed, rudely clothed, to signifie its activity, and lastingness, readiness of action, and aptnesses to do service; Upon the fringes of his garment was written Mors & vita, as signifying that in life and death the friendship was the same; on the forehead was written Summer and Winter, that is, prosperous and adverse accidents and states of life; the left arm and shoulder was bare and naked down to the heart to which the finger pointed, and there was written longè & propè: by all which we know that friendship does good far and near: in Summer and Winter, in life and death, and knows no difference of state or acci∣dent but by the variety of her services: and therefore ask no more to what we can be obliged by friendship; for it is every thing that can be honest and prudent, use∣ful and necessary. For this is all the allay of this Univer∣sality, we may do any thing or suffer any Page  59 thing, that is wise or necessary, or greatly beneficial to my friend, and that in any thing, in which I am perfect master of my person and fortunes. But I would not in bravery visit my friend when he is sick of the plague, unless I can do him good e∣qual at least to my danger, but I will pro∣cure him Physicians and prayers, all the assistances that he can receive, and that he can desire, if they be in my power: and when he is dead, I will not run into his grave and be stifled with his earth; but I will mourn for him, and perform his will, and take care of his relatives, and do for him as if he were alive, and I think that is the meaning of that hard saying of a Greek Poet.   〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.   To me though distant let thy friendship fly, Though men be mortal, friendships must not die, Of all things else there's great sa∣tiety.  Page  60 Of such immortal abstracted pure friend∣ships indeed there is no great plenty, and to see brothers hate each other, is not so rare as to see them love at this rate. The dead and the absent have but few friends, say the Spaniards; but they who are the same to their friend 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, when he is in another Countrey, or in another World, these are they who are fit to pre∣serve the sacred fire for eternal sacrifices, and to perpetuate the memory of those exemplar friendships of the best men which have filled the World with history and wonder: for in no other sense but this, can it be true; that friendships are pure loves; regarding to do good more than to receive it: He that is a friend after death, hopes not for a recompense from his friend, and makes no bargain either for fame or love; but is rewarded with the conscience and satisfaction of doing brave∣ly: but then this is demonstration that they choose Friends best who take persons so worthy that can and will do so: This is the profit and usefulness of friendship; and he that contracts such a noble Union, must take care that his friend be such who Page  61 can and will; but hopes that himself shall be first used, and put to act it: I will not have such a friendship that is good for no∣thing, but I hope that I shall be on the gi∣ving and assisting part; and yet if both the friends be so noble, and hope and strive to do the benefit, I cannot well say which ought to yield; and whether that friend∣ship were braver that could be content to be unprosperous so his friend might have the glory of assisting him; or that which desires to give assistances in the greatest measures of friendship: but he that choo∣ses a worthy friend that himself in the days of sorrow and need might receive the ad∣vantage, hath no excuse, no pardon, un∣less himself be as certain to do assistances when evil fortune shall require them. The sum of this answer to this enquiry I give you in a pair of Greek verses.   〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.   Friends are to friends as letter Gods, while they Honour and service to each other pay.  Page  62But when a dark cloud comes, grudge not to lend Thy head, thy heart, thy fortune to thy friend.   3. The last inquiry is, how friendships are to be conducted? That is, what are the duties in presence and in absence; whether the friend may not desire to enjoy his friend as well as his friendship? The answer to which in a great measure depends upon what I have said already: and if friend∣ship be a charity in society, and is not for contemplation and noise, but for material comforts and noble treatments and usages, this is no peradventure, but that if I buy land, I may eat the fruits, and if I take a house I may dwell in it; and if I love a worthy person, I may please my self in his society: and in this there is no exception, unless the friendship be between persons of a different sex: for then not only the interest of their religion, and the care of their honour, but the worthiness of their friendship requires that their entercourse be prudent and free from suspicion and reproach: and if a friend is obliged to bear a calamity, so he secure the honour Page  63 of his friend, it will concern him to con∣duct his entercourse in the lines of a ver∣tuous prudence, so that he shall rather lose much of his own comfort, than she any thing of her honour; and in this case the noises of people are so to be regarded, that next to innocence they are the prin∣cipal. But when by caution and prudence and severe conduct, a friend hath done all that he or she can to secure fame and ho∣nourable reports; after this, their noises are to be despised; they must not fright us from our friendships, nor from her fairest entercourses; I may lawfully pluck the clusters from my own Vine, though he that walks by, calls me thief. But by the way (Madam) you may see how much I differ from the morosity of those Cynicks who would not admit your sex into the communities of a noble friend∣ship. I believe some Wives have been the best friends in the World; and few stories can out do the nobleness and piety of that Lady that suck'd the poysonous, purulent matter from the wound of our brave Prince in the holy Land, when an Assasine had pierc'd him with a venom'd Page  64 arrow; and if it be told that Women can∣not retain counsel, and therefore can be no brave friends; I can best confute them by the story of Porcia, who being fearful of the weakness of her sex, stabb'd her self into the thigh to try how she could bear pain; and finding her self constant enough to that sufferance, gently chid her Brutus for not daring to trust her, since now she perceived that no torment could wrest that secret from her, which she hoped might be intrusted to her. If there were not more things to be said for your satisfacti∣on, I could have made it disputable whe∣ther have been more illustrious in their friendships Men or Women? I cannot say that Women are capable of all those excellencies by which Men can oblige the World; and therefore a female friend in some cases is not so good a counsellor as a wise man, and cannot so well defend my honour; nor dispose of reliefs and assist∣ances if she be under the power of ano∣ther: but a woman can love as passionate∣ly, and converse as pleasantly, and retain a secret as faithfully, and be useful in her proper ministeries; and she can die for her friend as well as the bravest RomanPage  65 Knight; and we find that some persons have engag'd themselves as far as death upon a less interest than all this amounts to: such were the 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, as the Greeks call them, the Devoti of a Prince or General, the Assasines amongst the Sa∣racens, the 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 amongst the old Ga∣latians: they did as much as a friend could do; and if the greatest services of a friend can be paid for by an ignoble price, we cannot grudge to vertuous and brave wo∣men that they be partners in a noble friend∣ship, since their conversation and returns can add so many moments to the felicity of our lives; and therefore, though a Knife cannot enter as far as a Sword, yet a Knife may be more useful to some purposes; and in every thing, except it be against an enemy. A man is the best friend in trouble, but a woman may be equal to him in the days of joy: a woman can as well increase our comforts, but cannot so well lessen our sorrows: and therefore we do not carry women with us when we go to fight; but in peaceful Cities and times, vertuous women are the beauties of society and the prettinesses of friendship. And when we consider that few persons in the Page  66 world have all those excellencies by which friendship can be useful and illustrious, we may as well allow women as men to be friends; since they can have all that which can be necessary and essential to friend∣ships, and these cannot have all by which friendships can be accidentally improved; in all some abatements will be made; and we shall do too much honour to women if we reject them from friendships because they are not perfect: for if to friendships we admit imperfect men, because no man is perfect: he that rejects women does find fault with them because they are not more perfect than men, which either does secretly affirm that they ought and can be perfect, or else it openly accuses men of injustice and partiality. I hope you will pardon me that I am a little gone from my undertaking, I went aside to wait upon the women and to do countenance to their tender vertues: I am now return'd, and, if I were to do the office of a guide to uninstructed friends, would add the particulars following: Ma∣dam, you need not read them now, but when any friends come to be taught by Page  67 your precept and example how to converse in the noblest conjurations, you may put these into better words and tell them, 1. That the first law of friendship is, they must neither ask of their friend what is Undecent; nor grant it if themselves be askt. For it is no good office to make my friend more vicious or more a fool; I will restrain his folly, but not nurse it; I will not make my groom the officer of my lust and vanity. There are Villains who sell their souls for bread, that offer sin and vanity at a price: I should be unwil∣ling my friend should know I am vicious; but if he could be brought to minister to it, he is not worthy to be my friend: and if I could offer it to him, I do not deserve to clasp hands with a vertuous person. 2. Let no Man chuse him for his friend whom it shall be possible for him ever af∣ter to hate, for though the society may justly be interrupted, yet love is an immor∣tal thing, and I will never despise him whom I could once think worthy of my love. A friend that proves not good is rather to be suffered, than any enmities be Page  68 entertained: and there are some outer of∣fices of friendship and little drudgeries in which the less worthy are to be imployed, and it is better that he be below stairs than quite thrown out of doors. 3. There are two things which a friend can never pardon, a treacherous blow and the revealing of a secret, because these are against the Nature of friendship; they are the adulteries of it, and dissolve the Uni∣on; and in the matters of friendship which is the marriage of souls; these are the proper causes of divorce: and therefore I shall add this only, that secrecy is the chastity of friendship, and the publication of it is a prostitution and direct debauche∣ry; but a secret, treacherous wound is a perfect and unpardonable Apostasie. I re∣member a pretty apologue that Bromiard tells, A Fowler in a sharp frosty morning having taken many little birds for which he had long watched, began to take up his Nets; and nipping the birds on the head laid them down. A young Thrush espying the tears trickling down his cheeks by rea∣son of the extreme cold, said to her Mo∣ther, that certainly the man was very mer∣ciful Page  69 and compassionate that wept so bit∣terly over the calamity of the poor Birds. But her Mother told her more wisely, that she might better judge of the man's dispo∣sition by his hand than by his eye; and if the hands do strike treacherously, he can never be admitted to friendship, who speaks fairly and weeps pitifully. Friendship is the greatest honesty and ingenuity in the World. 4. Never accuse thy friend, nor believe him that does; if thou dost, thou hast broken the skin; but he that is angry with every little fault breaks the bones of friendship; and when we consider that in society and the accidents of every day, in which no man is constantly pleased or displeased with the same things; we shall find reason to impute the change unto our selves; and the emanations of the Sun are still glorious, when our eyes are fore: and we have no reason to be angry with an eternal light, because we have a change∣able and a mortal faculty. But however, do not think thou didst contract alliance with an Angel, when thou didst take thy friend into thy bosom; he may be weak Page  70 as well as thou art, and thou mayest need pardon as well as he, and  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. Theog.that man loves flattery more than friendship, who would not only have his friend, but all the contingencies of his friend to humour him. 5. Give thy friend counsel wisely and charitably, but leave him to his liberty whether he will follow thee or no: and be not angry if thy counsel be rejected: for, advice is no Empire, and he is not my friend that will be my Judge whether I will or no. Neoptolemus had never been honoured with the victory and spoils of Troy if he had attended to the tears and counsel of Lycomedes, who being afraid to venture the young man, fain would have had him sleep at home safe in his little Page  71 Island. He that gives advice to his friend and exacts obedience to it, does not the kindness and ingenuity of a friend, but the office and pertness of a School-master. 6. Never be a Judge between thy friends in any matter where both set their hearts upon the victory: If strangers or enemies be litigants, what ever side thou favourest, thou gettest a friend, but when friends are the parties thou losest one. 7. Never comport thy self so, as that thy friend can be afraid of thee: for then the state of the relation alters when a new and troublesome passion supervenes. ODERVNT quos METVVNT. Perfect love casteth out fear, and no man is friend to a Tyrant; but that friendship is Tyranny where the love is changed into fear, equality into empire, society into obedience; for then all my kindness to him also will be no better than flattery. 8. When you admonish your friend, let it be without bitterness; when you chide him, let it be without reproach; when you praise him, let it be with wor∣thy Page  72 purposes and for just causes, and in friendly measures; too much of that is flattery, too little is envy; if you do it justly, you teach him true measures: but when others praise him, rejoyce, though they praise not thee, and remember that if thou esteemest his praise to be thy dis∣paragement, thou art envious, but neither just nor kind. 9. When all things else are equal prefer an old friend before a new. If thou mean∣est to spend thy friend, and make a gain of him till he be weary, thou wilt esteem him as a beast of burden, the worse for his age; But if thou esteemest him by noble measures, he will be better to thee by thy being used to him, by trial and experience, by reciprocation of indearments, and an habitual worthiness. An old friend is like old wine, which when a man hath drunk, he doth not desire new, because he saith the old is better. But every old friend was new once; and if he be worthy keep the new one till he become old. 10. After all this, treat thy friend no∣bly, love to be with him, do to him all Page  73 the worthinesses of love and fair endear∣ment, according to thy capacity and his; Bear with his infirmities till they approach towards being criminal; but never dis∣semble with him, never despise him, ne∣ver leave him. * Give him gifts and up∣braid him not, ‖ and refuse not his kind∣nesses, and be sure never to despise the smalness or the impropriety of them. Confirmatur amor beneficio accepto: A gift (saith Solomon) fasteneth friendships; for as an eye that dwells long upon a star must be refreshed with lesser beauties and strengthened with greens and looking-glasses, lest the sight become amazed with too great a splendor; so must the love of friends sometimes be refreshed with mate∣rial Page  74 and low Caresses; lest by striving to be too divine it become less humane: It must be allowed its share of both: It is humane in giving pardon and fair constru∣ction, and openness and ingenuity, and keeping secrets; it hath something that is divine, because it is beneficent; but much because it is eternal. THE END.  Page  [unnumbered]FIVE LETTERS More, To PERSONS Changed, and Tempted to a Change IN THEIR RELIGION. By the same Author.   Page  [unnumbered]Page  77The I. LETTER. A Copy of the first Letter written to a Gentlewo∣man newly seduced to the Church of Rome.  M. B. I Was desirous of an opportunity in London to have discoursed with you concerning something of nearest con∣cernment to you, but the multitude of my little affairs hindred me, and have brought upon you this trouble to read a long Letter, which yet I hope you will be more willing to do, because it comes from one who hath a great respect to your per∣son, and a very great charity to your soul: I must confess I was on your behalf trou∣bled Page  78 when I heard you were fallen from the Communion of the Church of England, and entred into a voluntary, unnecessary schism, and departure from the Laws of the King, and the Communion of those with whom you have always lived in cha∣rity, going against those Laws in the de∣fence and profession of which your Hus∣band died, going from the Religion in which you were Baptized, in which for so many years, you lived piously and hoped for Heaven, and all this without any suf∣ficient reason, without necessity or just scandal ministred to you; and to aggra∣vate all this, you did it in a time when the Church of England was persecuted, when she was marked with the Characterisms of her Lord, the marks of the Cross of Jesus, that is, when she suffered for a holy cause and a holy conscience, when the Church of England was more glorious than at any time before; Even when she could shew more Martyrs and Confessors than any Church this day in Christendom, even then when a King died in the profession of her Religion, and thousands of Priests, learned and pious Men suffered the spoil∣ing of their goods rather than they would Page  79 forsake one Article of so excellent a Re∣ligion; So that seriously it is not easily to be imagined that any thing should move you, unless it be that which troubled the perverse Jews, and the Heathen Greek, Scandalum crucis, the scandal of the Cross; You stumbled at that Rock of offence, You left us because we were afflicted, les∣sened in outward circumstances and wrap∣ped in a cloud; but give me leave only to remind you of that sad saying of the Scripture, that you may avoid the conse∣quent of it; They that fall on this stone shall be broken in pieces, but they on whom it shall fall shall be grinded to powder. And if we should consider things but pru∣dently, it is a great argument that the sons of our Church are very conscientious and just in their perswasions, when it is evi∣dent, that we have no temporal end to serve, nothing but the great end of our souls, all our hopes of preferment are gone, all secular regards, only we still have truth on our sides, and we are not willing with the loss of truth to change from a persecuted to a prosperous Church, from a Reformed to a Church that will not be reformed; lest we give scandal to good Page  80 people that suffer for a holy conscience, and weaken the hands of the afflicted; of which if you had been more careful, you would have remained much more inno∣cent. But I pray, give me leave to consider for you, because you in your change con∣sidered so little for your self, what fault, what false doctrine, what wicked and dan∣gerous proposition, what defect, what amiss did you find in the Doctrine and Liturgy and Discipline of the Church of England? For its doctrine, It is certain it profes∣ses the belief of all that is written in the Old and New Testament, all that which is in the three Creeds, the Apostolical, the Nicene, and that of Athanasius, and whatsoever was decreed in the four Gene∣ral Councils, or in any other truly such, and whatsoever was condemned in these, our Church hath legally declared it to be Heresie. And upon these accounts above four whole ages of the Church went to Heaven; they baptized all their Catechu∣mens into this faith, their hopes of Hea∣ven Page  81 was upon this and a good life, their Saints and Martyrs lived and died in this alone, they denied Communion to none that professed this faith. This is the Ca∣tholick faith, so saith the Creed of Atha∣nasius; and unless a company of Men have power to alter the faith of God, whoso∣ever live and die in this faith, are intire∣ly Catholick and Christian. So that the Church of England hath the same faith without dispute that the Church had for 400. or 500. Years, and therefore there could be nothing wanting here to saving faith, if we live according to our belief. 2. For the Liturgy of the Church of England, I shall not need to say much, be∣cause the case will be very evident; First, Because the disputers of the Church of Rome have not been very forward to ob∣ject any thing against it, they cannot charge it with any evil: 2. Because for all the time of King Edw. 6. and till the eleventh year of Queen Elizabeth, your people came to our Churches and prayed with us, till the Bull of Pius Quintus came out upon temporal regards, and made a Schism by forbidding the Queens Subjects Page  82 to pray as by Law was here appointed, though the prayers were good and holy, as themselves did believe. That Bull en∣joyned Recusancy, and made that which was an act of Rebellion, and Disobedience, and Schism, to be the character of your Roman Catholicks. And after this, what can be supposed wanting in order to salva∣tion? We have the Word of God, the Faith of the Apostles, the Creeds of the Primitive Church, the Articles of the four first general Councils, a holy Liturgy, ex∣cellent Prayers, perfect Sacraments, Faith and Repentance, the Ten Commandments, and the Sermons of Christ, and all the pre∣cepts and counsels of the Gospel; We teach the necessity of good works, and require and strictly exact the severity of a holy life; We live in obedience to God, and are ready to die for him, and do so when he requires us so to do; We speak honourably of his most holy Name, we worship him at the mention of his Name, we confess his Attributes, we love his Ser∣vants, we pray for all Men, we love all Christians, even our most erring Brethren, we confess our sins to God and to our Brethren whom we have offended, and to Page  83 God's Ministers in cases of Scandal, or of a troubled Conscience. We communicate often, we are enjoyned to receive the holy Sacrament thrice every Year at least; Our Priests absolve the penitent, our Bishops ordain Priests, and confirm baptized per∣sons, and bless their people and intercede for them; and what could here be want∣ing to Salvation? what necessity forced you from us? I dare not suspect it was a temporal regard that drew you away, but I am sure it could be no spiritual. But now that I have told you, and made you to consider from whence yon went, give me leave to represent to you, and tell you whither you are gone, that you may understand the nature and conditions of your change: For do not think your self safe, because they tell you that you are come to the Church; You are indeed gone from one Church to another, from a better to a worse, as will appear in the induction; the particulars of which before I reckon, give me leave to give you this advice; if you mean in this affair to un∣derstand what you do; it were better you enquired what your Religion is, than what Page  84 your Church is; for that which is a true Religion to day, will be so to morrow and for ever; but that which is a holy Church to day, may be heretical at the next change, or may betray her trust, or obtrude new Articles in contradiction to the old, or by new interpretations may e∣lude ancient truths, or may change your Creed, or may pretend to be the Spouse of Christ when she is idolatrous, that is, adulterous to God: Your Religion is that which you must, and therefore may com∣petently understand; You must live in it; and grow in it, and govern all the actions of your life by it; and in all questions con∣cerning the Church, you are to choose your Church by the Religion, and there∣fore this ought first and last to be enqui∣red after. Whether the Roman Church be the Catholick Church, must depend upon so many uncertain enquiries, is offer∣ed to be proved by so long, so tedious a method, hath in it so many intrigues and Labyrinths of Question, and is (like a long line) so impossible to be perfectly straight, and to have no declination in it when it is held by such a hand as yours, that unless it be by material enquiries into Page  85 the Articles of the Religion, you can ne∣ver hope to have just grounds of confi∣dence. In the mean time you can consider this; if the Roman Church were the Ca∣tholick, that is, so as to exclude all that are not of her communion, then the Greek Churches had as good turn Turks as re∣main damned Christians, and all that are in the communion of all the other Patri∣archal Churches in Christendom, must also perish like Heathens, which thing before any Man can believe, he must have put off all reason, and all modesty, and all cha∣rity; And who can with any probability think that the Communion of Saints in the Creed is nothing but the Communion of Roman Subjets, and the Article of the Ca∣tholick Church was made up to dispark the inclosures of Jerusalem, but to turn them into the pale of Rome, and the Church is as limited as ever it was, save only that the Synagogue is translated to Rome, which I think you will easily be∣lieve was a Proposition the Apostles un∣derstood not. But though it be hard to trust to it, it is also so hard to prove it, that you shall be able to understand the measures of that question and there∣fore Page  86 your salvation can never depend upon it. For no good or wise person can be∣lieve that God hath tied our Salvation to impossible measures, or bound us to an Article that is not by us cognoscible, or intends to have us conducted by that which we cannot understand; and when you shall know that Learned men, even of the Ro∣man party are not agreed concerning the Catholick Church that is infallibly to guide you, some saying that it is the virtual Church, that is, the Pope; some, that it is the representative Church, that is, a Council; Some, that it is the Pope and the Council, the virtual Church and the representative Church together; Some that neither of these, nor both together are infallible; but only, the essential Church, or the diffusive Church is the Catholick, from whom we must at no hand dissent; you will quickly find your self in a wood, and uncertain whether you have more than a word in exchange for your soul, when you are told you are in the Catholick Church. But I will tell you what you may understand, and see and feel, something that your self can tell whether I say true or no concerning it. You are Page  87 now gone to a Church that protects it self by arts of subtilty and arms, by violence and persecuting all that are not of their minds, to a Church in which you are to be a Subject of the King so long as it plea∣ses the Pope: In which you may be absol∣ved from your Vows made to God, your Oaths to the King, your Promises to Men, your duty to your Parents in some cases: A Church in which Men pray to God, and to Saints in the same Form of words in which they pray to God, as you may see in the Offices of Saints, and particularly of our Lady: a Church in which Men are taught by most of the principal Leaders to worship Images with the same worship with which they worship God and Christ, or him or her whose Image it is, and in which they usually picture God the Fa∣ther, and the holy Trinity, to the great dishonour of that sacred mystery, against the doctrine and practice of the Primi∣tive Church, against the express doctrine of Scripture, against the honour of a Di∣vine Attribute; I mean, the immensity and spirituality of the Divine Nature; You are gone to a Church that pretends to be Infallible, and yet is infinitely deceived Page  88 in many particulars, and yet endures no contradiction, and is impatient her chil∣dren, should enquire into any thing her Priests obtrude. You are gone from re∣ceiving the whole Sacrament to receive it but half; from Christ's Institution to a hu∣mane invention, from Scripture to uncer∣tain Traditions, and from ancient Tradi∣tions to new pretences, from prayers which ye understood to prayers which ye under∣stand not, from confidence in God to re∣ly upon creatures, from intire dependence upon inward acts to a dangerous tempta∣tion of resting too much in outward mini∣steries, in the external work of Sacraments and of Sacramentals: You are gone from a Church whose worshipping is simple, Christian and Apostolical, to a Church where Mens consciences are loaden with a burden of Ceremonies greater than that in the days of the Jewish Religion (for the Ceremonial of the Church of Rome is a great Book in Folio) greater I say than all the Ceremonies of the Jews contained in Leviticus, &c. You are gone from a Church where you were exhorted to read the Word of God, the holy Scriptures from whence you found instruction, insti∣tution, Page  89 comfort, reproof, a treasure of all excellencies, to a Church that seals up that fountain from you, and gives you drink by drops out of such Cisterns as they first make, and then stain, and then reach out: and if it be told you that some Men abuse Scripture, it is true, for if your Priests had not abused Scripture, they could not thus have abused you, but there is no ne∣cessity they should, and you need not, un∣less you list; any more than you need to abuse the Sacraments or decrees of the Church, or the messages of your friend, or the Letters you receive, or the Laws of the Land, all which are liable to be abu∣sed by evil persons, but not by good peo∣ple and modest understandings. It is now become a part of your Religion to be ig∣norant, to walk in blindness, to believe the Man that hears your Confessions, to hear none but him, not to hear God speak∣ing but by him, and so you are liable to be abused by him, as he please, without remedy. You are gone from us, where you were only taught to worship God through Jesus Christ, and now you are taught to worship Saints and Angels with a worship at least dangerous, and in some Page  90 things proper to God; for your Church worships the Virgin Mary with burning incense and candles to her, and you give her presents, which by the consent of all Nations used to be esteemed a worship pe∣culiar to God, and it is the same thing which was condemned for Heresie in the Collyridians, who offered a Cake to the Virgin Mary; A Candle and a Cake make no difference in the worship; and your joyning God and the Saints in your worship and devotions, is like the device of them that fought for King and Parlia∣ment, the latter destroys the former. I will trouble you with no more particulars, because if these move you not to consider better, nothing can. But yet I have two things more to add of another nature, one of which at least may prevail upon you, whom I suppose to have a tender and a religious Consci∣ence. The first is, That all the points of dif∣ference between us and your Church are such as do evidently serve the ends of Co∣vetousness and ambition, of power and Page  91 riches, and so stand vehemently suspected of design, and art, rather than truth of the Article and designs upon Heaven. I instance in the Pope's power over Princes and all the World; his power of dispen∣sation, The exemption of the Clergy from jurisdiction of Princes, The Doctrine of Purgatory and Indulgences which was once made means to raise a portion for a Lady, the Neece of Pope Leo the Tenth; The Priests power advanced beyond authority of any warrant from Scripture, a doctrine apt to bring absolute obedience to the Pa∣pacy; but because this is possibly too nice for you to suspect or consider, that which I am sure ought to move you is this. That you are gone to a Religion in which though through God's grace pre∣vailing over the follies of men, there are I hope, and charitably suppose many pi∣ous Men that love God, and live good lives, yet there are very many doctrines taught by your Men, which are very ill Friends to a good life. I instance in your Indulgences and pardons, in which viti∣ous men put a great confidence, and rely greatly upon them. The doctrine of Pur∣gatory Page  92 which gives countenance to a sort of Christians who live half to God and half to the World, and for them this do∣ctrine hath found out a way that they may go to Hell and to Heaven too. The Do∣ctrine that the Priests absolution can turn a trifling repentance into a perfect and a good, and that suddenly too, and at any time, even on our Death-bed, or the mi∣nute before your death, is a dangerous heap of falshoods, and gives licence to wicked people, and teaches men to recon∣cile a wicked debauched life, with the hopes of Heaven. And then for penan∣ces and temporal satisfaction, which might seem to be as a plank after the shipwrack of the duty of Repentance, to keep men in awe, and to preserve them from sink∣ing in an Ocean of Impiety, it comes to just nothing by your doctrine; for there are so many easie ways of Indulgences and getting Pardons, so many con-fraternities, stations, priviledg'd Altars, little Offices, Agnus Dei's, amulets, hallowed devices, swords, roses, hats, Church-yards, and the fountain of these annexed indulgences the Pope himself, and his power of grant∣ing what, and when, and to whom he list, Page  93 that he is a very unfortunate man that needs to smart with penances; and after all, he may choose to suffer any at all, for he may pay them in Purgatory if he please, and he may come out of Purgatory upon reasonable terms, in case he should think it fit to go thither; So that all the whole duty of Repentance seems to be destroyed with devices of Men that seek power and gain, and find errour and folly; insomuch that if I had a mind to live an evil Life, and yet hope for Heaven at last, I would be of your religion above any in the World. But I forget I am writing a Letter: I shall therefore desire you to consider upon the premises, which is the safer way. For surely it is lawful for a Man to serve God without Images; but that to worship I∣mages is lawful, is not so sure. It is law∣ful to pray to God alone, to confess him to be true, and every Man a liar, to call no man Master upon Earth, but to rely up∣on God teaching us; But it is at least hugely disputable and not at all certain that any Man, or society of Men can be infallible, that we may put our trust in Page  94 Saints, in certain extraordinary Images, or burn Incense and offer consumptive oblati∣ons to the Virgin Mary, or make vows to persons, of whose state, or place, or ca∣pacities, or condition we have no certain revelation: we are sure we do well when in the holy Communion we worship God and Jesus Christ our Saviour, but they who also worship what seems to be bread, are put to strange shifts to make themselves believe it to be lawful. It is certainly lawful to believe what we see and feel; but it is an unnatural thing upon pretence of faith to disbelieve our eyes, when our sense and our faith can better be reconciled, as it is in the question of the Real presence, as it is taught by the Church of England. So that unless you mean to prefer a dan∣ger before safety, temptation to unholi∣ness before a severe and a holy religion, unless you mean to lose the benefit of your prayers by praying what you perceive not, and the benefit of the Sacrament in great degrees by falling from Christ's insti∣tution, and taking half instead of all; un∣less you desire to provoke God to jealou∣sie by Images, and Man to jealousie in Page  95 professing a Religion in which you may in many cases have leave to forfeit your faith and lawful trust, unless you will still con∣tinue to give scandal to those good people with whom you have lived in a common Religion, and weaken the hearts of Gods afflicted ones, unless you will choose a Ca∣techism without the second Commandment, and a Faith that grows bigger or less as men please, and a Hope that in many de∣grees relyes on men and vain confidences, and a Charity that damns all the World but your selves; unless you will do all this, that is, suffer an abuse in your Prayers, in the Sacrament, in the Commandments, in Faith, in Hope, in Charity, in the Communion of Saints, and your duty to your Supreme, you must return to the bo∣som of your Mother the Church of Eng∣land from whence you have fallen, rather weakly than maliciously, and I doubt not but you will find the Comfort of it all your Life, and in the Day of your Death, and in the Day of Judgment. If you will not, yet I have freed mine own soul, and done an act of Duty and Charity, which at least you are bound to take kindly if you will not entertain it obediently. Page  96Now let me add this, that although most of these objections are such things which are the open and avowed doctrines or practices of your Church, and need not to be proved as being either notorious or confessed; yet if any of your Guides shall seem to question any thing of it, I will bind my self to verifie it to a tittle, and in that too which I intend them, that is, so as to be an objection obliging you to return, under the pain of folly or he∣resie, or disobedience, according to the subject matter. And though I have pro∣pounded these things now to your consi∣deration, yet if it be desired I shall repre∣sent them to your eye, so that even your self shall be able to give sentence in the behalf of truth. In the mean time give me leave to tell you of how much folly you are guilty in being moved by such mock-arguments as your men use when they meet with women and tender consci∣ences and weaker understanding. The first is; where was your Church before Luther? Now if you had called upon them to speak something against Page  97 your religion from Scripture, or right reason, or Universal Tradition, you had been secure as a Tortoise in her shell; a Cart pressed with sheaves could not have oppressed your cause or person, though you had confessed you understood nothing of the mysteries of succession doctrinal or personal. For if we can make it ap∣pear that our religion was that which Christ and his Apostles taught, let the truth suffer what eclipses or prejudices can be supposed, let it be hid like the holy fire in the captivity, yet what Christ and his Apostles taught us is eternally true, and shall by some means or other be conveyed to us; even the enemies of truth have been conservators of that truth by which we can confute their er∣rors. But if you still ask where it was before Luther? I answer it was there where it was after; even in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament; and I know no warrant for any other religion; and if you will expect I should shew any society of Men who professed all the do∣ctrines which are now expressed in the confession of the Church of England; I shall tell you it is unreasonable; because Page  98 some of our truths are now brought into our publick confessions that they might be oppos'd against your errors; before the occasion of which there was no need of any such confessions, till you made ma∣ny things necessary to be professed, which are not lawful to be believed. For if we believe your superinduc'd follies, we shall do unreasonably, unconscionably, and wick∣edly; but the questions themselves are so useless abstracting from the accidental ne∣cessity which your follies have brought upon us, that it had been happy if we had never heard of them more than the Saints and Martyrs did in the first ages of the Church; but because your Clergy have invaded the liberty of the Church, and multiplied the dangers of damnation, and pretend new necessities, and have intro∣duc'd new articles, and affright the simple upon new pretensions, and slight the very institution and the Commands of Christ and of the Apostles, and invent new Sa∣cramentals constituting Ceremonies of their own head, and promise grace along with the use of them, as if they were not Ministers but Lords of the Spirit, and teach for doctrines the commandments of Page  99 men, and make void the Commandment of God by their tradition, and have made a strange body of Divinity; therefore it is necessary that we should immure our Faith by the refusal of such vain and superstiti∣ous dreams: but our faith was completed at first, it is no other than that which was delivered to the Saints, and can be no more for ever. So that it is a foolish demand to require that we should shew before Luther a sy∣steme of Articles declaring our sense in these questions: It was long before they were questions at all; and when they were made questions, they remained so, a long time; and when by their several pieces they were determined, this part of the Church was oppressed with a violent po∣wer; and when God gave opportunity, then the yoke was broken; and this is the whole progress of this affair. But if you will still insist upon it, then let the matter be put into equal ballances, and let them shew any Church whose confession of Faith was such as was obtruded upon you at Trent: and if your Religion be Pius Quartus his Creed at Trent, then we Page  100 also have a question to ask, and that is Where was your Religion before Trent? The Council of Trent determined that the souls departed before the Day of Judg∣ment enjoy the Beatifical Vison. It is certain this Article could not be shewn in the Confession of any of the ancient Chur∣ches; for most of the Fathers were of a∣nother opinion. But that which is the greatest offence of Christendom is not on∣ly that these doctrines which we say are false were yet affirmed, but that those things which the Church of God did al∣ways reject, or held as uncertain, should be made Articles of Faith, and so become parts of your religion; and of these it is that I again ask the question which none of your side shall ever be able to answer for you: Where was your Religion be∣fore Trent? I could instance in many par∣ticulars; but I shall name one to you, which because the thing of it self is of no great consequence, it will appear the more unreasonable and intolerable that your Church should adopt it into the things of necessary belief, especially since it was on∣ly a matter of fact, and they took the Page  101 false part too. For in the 21. Sess. Chap. 4. it is affirmed, That although the holy Fa∣thers did give the Sacrament of the Eucha∣rist to Infants, yet they did it without any necessity of salvation; that is, they did not believe it necessary to their salvation, which is notoriously false, and the contra∣ry is marked out with the black-lead of every man almost that reads their Works; and yet your Council says this is fine con∣troversiâ credendum; to be believed with∣out all controversie: and all Christians forbidden to believe or teach otherwise. So that here it is made an Article of Faith amongst you, that a man shall neither be∣lieve his reason nor his eyes: and who can shew any confession of Faith in which all the Trent doctrine was professed and enjoyned under pain of damna∣tion?* and before the Council of Constance, the Doctrine touching the Popes power was so new, so decried, that as Gerson says he hardly should have escaped the note of He∣resie that would have said so much as was there defined: so that in that Article which now makes a great part of your be∣lief, where was your Religion before the Page  102 Council of Constance? and it is notorious that your Council of Constance determined the doctrine of the half-communion with a Non obstante to Christ's institution, that is, with a defiance to it, or a noted, ob∣served neglect of it, and with a profession it was otherwise in the Primitive Church. Where then was your Religion before John Hus and Hierom of Prague's time, against whom that Council was convened? But by this instance it appears most cer∣tainly that your Church cannot shew her confessions immediately after Christ, and therefore if we could not shew ours im∣mediately before Luther, it were not half so much; for since you receded from Christ's Doctrine we might well recede from yours; and it matters not who or how many or how long they professed your doctrine, if neither Christ nor his Apostles did teach it: so that if these Ar∣ticles constitute your Church, your Church was invisible at the first, and if ours was invisible afterwards, it matters not; For yours was invisible in the days of light, and ours was invisible in the days of darkness. For our Church was always visible in the reflections of Scripture, and he that had Page  103 his eyes of faith and reason might easily have seen these truths all the way which constitute our Church. But I add yet far∣ther, that our Church before Luther was there where your Church was, in the same place and in the same persons; for divers of the errors which have been amongst us reformed, were not the constituent Ar∣ticles of your Church before Luther's time; for before the last Councils of your Church a man might have been of your Communion upon easier terms; and Indul∣gences were indeed a practice, but no Ar∣ticle of Faith before your men made it so, and that very lately, and so were many other things besides. So that although your men cozen the credulous and the simple by calling yours The old Religion, yet the difference is vast between Truth and their affirmative, even as much as be∣tween old Errors and new Articles. For although Ignorance and Superstition had prepared the ore, yet the Councils of Con∣stance and Basil, and Trent especially, were the sorges and the mint. Lastly, if your men had not by all the vile and violent arts of the World stopped Page  104 the mouths of dissenters, the question would quickly have been answered, or our Articles would have been so confessed, so owned and so publick, that the question could never have been asked; but in de∣spite of all opposition, there were great numbers of professors who did protest and profess and practise our doctrines contrary to your Articles; as it is demon∣strated by the Divines of Germany in Illy∣ricus his Catalogus testium veritatis, and in Bishop Mortons appeal. But with your next objection you are better pleased, and your Men make most noise with it. For you pretend that by our confession salvation may be had in your Church; but your men deny it to us; and therefore by the confession of both sides you may be safe, and there is no question concerning you; but of us there is great question, for none but our selves say that we can be saved. I answer, 1. That salvation may be had in your Church, is it ever the truer be∣cause we say it? If it be not, it can add no confidence to you, for the proposition Page  105 gets no strength by your affirmative. But if it be, then our authority is good or else our reason; and if either be, then we have more reason to be believed speaking of our selves; because we are concerned to see that our selves may be in a state of hope; and therefore we would not ven∣ture on this side if we had not greater rea∣son to believe well of our selves than of you. And therefore believe us when it is more likely that we have greater reason, because we have greater concernments, and therefore greater considerations. 2. As much charity as your Men pre∣tend us to speak of you, yet it is a clear case our hope of your salvation is so little that we dare not venture our selves on your side. The Burger of Oldwater be∣ing to pass a River in his Journey to Da∣ventry, had his Man try the Ford; telling him he hoped he should not be drowned, for though he was afraid the River was too deep, yet he thought his Horse would carry him out, or at least, the Boats would fetch him off. Such a confidence we may have of you, but you will find that but little warranty, if you remember how Page  106 great an interest it is that you venture. 3. It would be remembred that though the best ground of your hope is not the goodness of your own faith, but the great∣ness of our charity; yet we that charita∣bly hope well of you, have a fulness of assurance of the truth and certainty of our own way; and however you can please your selves with Images of things as ha∣ving no firm footing for your trifling con∣fidence, yet you can never with your tricks out face us of just and firm adherencies; and if you were not empty of supports, and greedy of bulrushes, snatching at any thing to support your sinking cause, you would with fear and trembling consider the direct dangers which we demonstrate to you to be in your religion rather than flatter your selves with collateral, weak, and deceitful hopes of accidental possibili∣ties, that some of you may escape. 4. If we be more charitable to you than you are to us, acknowledge in us the beau∣ty and essential form of Christian Reli∣gion; be sure you love as well as make use of our charity; but if you make our Page  107 charity an argument against us, remember that you render us evil in exchange for good; and let it be no brag to you that you have not that charity to us; for there∣fore the Donatists were condemned for Hereticks and Schismaticks because they damn'd all the World, and afforded no charity to any that was not of their Com∣munion. 5. But that our charity may be such in∣deed, that is, that it may do you a real benefit, and not turn into Wormwood and Colloquintida, I pray take notice in what sense it is that we allow salvation may pos∣sibly be had in your Church. We war∣rant it not to any, we only hope it for some, we allow it to them as to the Sad∣ducees in the Law, and to the Corinthians in the Gospel who denied the resurrecti∣on; that is, till they were sufficiently in∣structed, and competently convinced, and had time and powers to out-wear their prejudices and the impresses of their edu∣cation and long perswasion. But to them amongst you who can and do consider and yet determine for error and interest, we have a greater charity, even so much Page  108 as to labour and pray for their conversion, but not so much fondness as to flatter them into boldness and pertinacious adherencies to matters of so great danger. 6. But in all this afrair, though your men are very bold with God and leap into his Judgment-seat before him, and give wild sentences concerning the salvation of your own party and the damnation of all that disagree, yet that which is our chari∣ty to you, is indeed the fear of God, and the reverence of his judgments; we do not say that all Papists are certainly damn'd; we wish and desire vehemently that none of you may perish; but then this charity of judgment relates not to you, nor is derived from any probability which we see in your doctrines that differ from ours; but because we know not what rate and value God puts upon the article; It concerns neither you nor us to say, this or that man shall be damn'd for his opi∣nion; for besides that this is a bold intru∣sion into that secret of God which shall not be opened till the Day of Judgment, and besides that we know not what allays and abatements are to be made by the Page  109 good meaning and the ignorance of the man; all that can concern us is to tell you that you are in error, that you depart from Scripture, that you exercise tyranny over souls, that you leave the Divine in∣stitution, and prevaricate Gods Command∣ment, that you divide the Church without truth and without necessity, that you tie Men to believe things under pain of dam∣nation which cannot be made very pro∣bable, much less certain; and therefore that you sin against God and are in danger of his eternal displeasure; but in giving the final sentence as we have no more to do than your men have, yet so we refuse to follow your evil example; and we fol∣low the glorious precedent of our Blessed Lord; who decreed and declared against the crime, but not against the Criminal before the day. He that does this, or that, is in danger of the Council, or in danger of judgment, or liable and obnoxi∣ous to the danger of hell fire; so we say of your greatest errors; they put you in the danger of perishing; but that you shall or shall not perish, we leave it to your Judge; and if you call this charity, it is well, I am sure it is piety and the fear of God. Page  1107. Whether you may be saved, or whe∣ther you shall be damned for your errors, does neither depend upon our affirmative nor your negative, but according to the rate and value which God sets upon things. Whatever we talk, things are as they are, not as we dispute, or grant, or hope; and therefore it were well if your men would leave abusing you and themselves with these little arts of indirect support. For many men that are warranted, yet do e∣ternally perish, and you in your Church damn Millions who I doubt not shall reign with Jesus eternally in the Heavens. 8. I wish you would consider, that if any of our men say salvation may be had in your Church, it is not for the goodness of your new propositions, but only be∣cause you do keep so much of that which is our Religion, that upon the confidence of that we hope well concerning you. And we do not hope any thing at all that is good of you or your Religion as it distinguishes from us and ours: we hope that the good which you have common with us may ob∣tain pardon directly or indirectly, or may Page  111 be an antidote of the venome, and an amu∣let against the danger of your very great errors, so that if you can derive any con∣fidence from our concession, you must re∣member where it takes root; not upon any thing of yours, but wholly upon the excellency of ours; you are not at all safe, or warranted for being Papists, but we hope well of some of you, for having so much of the Protestant: and if that will do you any good, proceed in it, and fol∣low it whithersoever it leads you. 9. The safety that you dream of which we say to be on your side, is nothing of allowance or warranty, but a hope that is collateral, indirect and relative; we do not say any thing whereby you can con∣clude yours to be safer than ours, for it is not safe at all, but extremely dangerous; we affirm those errors in themselves to be damnable, some to contain in them Impi∣ety, some to have Sacriledge, some Idola∣try, some Superstition, some practices to be conjuring and charming and very like to Witchcraft, as in your hallowing of Wa∣ter, and baptizing Bells, and exorcizing Demoniacks; and what safety there can be Page  112 in these, or what you can fancy we should allow to you, I suppose you need not boast of. Now because we hope some are sa∣ved amongst you, you must not conclude yours to be safe; for our hope relies upon this. There are many of your propositi∣ons in which we differ from you, that Thousands amongst you understand and know nothing of, it is to them as if they were not, it is to them now as it was be∣fore the Council, they hear not of it. And though your Priests have taken a course that the most ignorant do practise some of your abominations most grosly, yet we hope this will not be laid upon them who (as S. Austin's expression is) cautâ solli∣citudine quaerunt veritatem, corrigi parati cùm invenerint: do according as they are able warily and diligently seek for truth, and are ready to follow it when they find it; Men who live good lives, and repent of all their evils known and unknown. Now if we are not deceived in our hopes, these Men shall rejoyce in the eternal good∣ness of God, which prevails over the ma∣lice of them that misguide you; but if we be deceived in our hopes of you, your guides have abus'd you, and the blind Page  113 leaders of the blind will fall together. For, 10. If you will have the secret of this whole affair, this it is. The hopes we have of any of you, (as it is known) principally relies upon the hopes of your repentance. Now we say that a Man may repent of an error which he knows not of; as he that prays heartily for the pardon of all his sins and errors known and unknown; by his general repentance may obtain many degrees and instances of mercy. Now thus much also your Men allow to us; those who live well, and die in a true though but general repentance of their sins and errors even amongst us, your best and wisest Men pronounce to be in a favable condition. Here then we are equal, and we are as safe by your confession as you are by ours. But because there are some Bigots of your faction fierce and fiery who say that a general repentance will not serve our turns, but it must be a particu∣lar renunciation of Protestancy; these men deny not only to us but to themselves too, all that comfort which they derive from our Concession, and indeed which they Page  114 can hope for from the mercies of God. For be you sure we think as ill of your errors as you can suppose of our Articles; and therefore if for errors (be they on which side it chances) a general repen∣tance will not serve the turn without an actual dereliction, then flatter not your selves by any thing of our kindness to your party; for you must have a parti∣cular if a general be not sufficient. But if it be sufficient for you, it is so for us, in case we be in error as your men sup∣pose us; but if it will not suffice us for remedy to those errors you charge us with, neither will it suffice you; for the case must needs be equal as to the value of repentance and malignity of the error: and therefore these men condemn them∣selves and will not allow us to hope well of them; but if they will allow us to hope, it must be by affirming the value of a general repentance; and if they allow that, they must hope as well of ours as we of theirs: but if they deny it to us, they deny it to themselves, and then they can no more brag of any thing of our con∣cession. This only I add to this considera∣tion; that your men do not, cannot charge Page  115 upon us any doctrine that is in its matter and effect impious; there is nothing po∣sitive in our doctrine, but is either true or innocent, but we are accus'd for denying your superstructures: ours therefore (if we be deceived) is but like a sin of omis∣sion; yours are sins of commission in case you are in the wrong (as we believe you to be) and therefore you must needs be in a greater danger than we can be suppo∣sed, by how much sins of omission are less than sins of commission. 11. Your very way of arguing from our charity is a very fallacy and a trick that must needs deceive you if you rely upon it. For whereas your men argue thus: The Protestants say we Papists may be saved; and so say we too: but we Pa∣pists say that you Protestants cannot, there∣fore it is safest to be a Papist; consider that of this argument if it shall be accepted, any bold heretick can make use, against any modest Christian of a true perswasion. For, if he can but out-face the modesty of the good man, and tell him he shall be damn'd; unless that modest man say as much of him, you see impudence shall get Page  116 the better of the day. But it is thus in every error. Fifteen Bishops of Jerusa∣lem in immediate succession were circum∣cised, believing it to be necessary so to be: with these other Christian Churches who were of the uncircumcision did communi∣cate: Suppose now that these Bishops had not only thought it necessary for them∣selves but for others too; this argument you see was ready: you of the uncircum∣cision who do communicate with us, think that we may be saved though we are cir∣cumcised, but we do not think that you who are not circumcised can be saved, therefore it is the safest way to be circum∣cised: I suppose you would not have thought their argument good, neither would you have had your children circum∣cised. But this argument may serve the Presbyterians as well as the Papists. We are indeed very kind to them in our sen∣tences concerning their salvation; and they are many of them as unkind to us; If they should argue so as you do, and say, you Episcopal men think we Presbyterians though in errors can be saved, and we say so too: but we think you Episcopal men are Enemies of the Kingdom of Jesus Page  117 Christ; and therefore we think you in a damnable condition, therefore it is safer to be a Presbyterian: I know not what your men would think of the argument in their hands, I am sure we had reason to complain that we are used very ill on both hands for no other cause but because we are charitable. But it is not our case a∣lone; but the old Catholicks were used just so by the Donatists in this very argu∣ment, as we are used by your men. The Donatists were so fierce against the Catho∣licks, that they would re-baptize all them who came to their Churches from the o∣ther: But the Catholicks, as knowing the Donatists did give right Baptism, admitted their Converts to Repentance, but did not re-baptize them. Upon this score, the Donatists triumphed, saying, You Catho∣licks confess our Baptism to be good, and so say we: But we Donatists deny your Baptism to be good; therefore it is safer to be of our side than yours. Now what should the Catholicks say or do? Should they lie for God and for Religion, and to serve the ends of Truth say the Donatists Baptism was not good? That they ought not. Should they damn all the Donatists, Page  118 and make the rent wider? It was too great already. What then? They were quiet, and knew that the Donatists sought advan∣tages by their own fierceness, and tram∣pled upon the others charity; but so they hardned themselves in error, and became evil, because the others were good. I shall trouble you no further now, but desire you to consider of these things with as much caution, as they were written with charity. Till I hear from you, I shall pray to God to open your heart and your under∣standing, that you may return from whence you are fallen, and repent, and do your first work, Which that you may do, is the hearty desire of Your very affectionate Friend and Servant, JER. TAYLOR.   Page  119The II. Letter. Written to a Person newly converted to the Church of England.  Madam, I Bless God I am safely arrived where I desired to be after my unwilling departure from the place of your a∣bode and danger: And now because I can have no other expression of my ten∣derness, I account that I have a treble Ob∣ligation to signifie it by my care of your biggest and eternal interest. And because it hath pleased God to make me an Instru∣ment of making you to understand in some fair measure the excellencies of a true and holy Religion, and that I have pointed out such follies and errors in the Roman Page  120 Church, at which your understanding be∣ing forward and pregnant, did of it self start as at imperfect ill-looking Proposi∣tions, give me leave to do that now which is the purpose of my Charity, that is, teach you to turn this to the advantage of a holy life, that you may not only be chan∣ged but converted. For the Church of England whither you are now come is not in condition to boast her self in the repu∣tation of changing the opinion of a single person, though never so excellent; She hath no temporal ends to serve which must stand upon fame and noises; all that she can design, is to serve God, to advance the honour of the Lord, and the good of souls, and to rejoyce in the Cross of Christ. First, therefore I desire you to remem∣ber that as now you are taught to pray both publickly and privately, in a Lan∣guage understood, so it is intended your affections should be forward, in propor∣tion to the advantages which your prayer hath in the understanding part. For though you have been often told and have heard, that ignorance is the mother of devotion, Page  121 you will find that the proposition is unna∣tural and against common sense and experi∣ence; because it is impossible to desire that of which we know nothing, unless the de∣sire it self be fantastical and illusive: it is necessary that in the same proportion in which we understand any good thing, in the same we shall also desire it, and the more particular and minute your notices are, the more passionate and material also your af∣fections will be towards it; and if they be good things for which we are taught to pray, the more you know them the more reason you have to love them; It is mon∣strous to think that devotion, that is, passi∣onate desires of religious things, and the earnest prosecutions of them should be produced by any thing of ignorance or less perfect notices in any sense. Since there∣fore you are taught to pray, so that your understanding is the praecentor or the Ma∣ster of the Quire, and you know what you say; your desires are made humane, reli∣gious, express, material (for these are the advantages of Prayers and Liturgies well understood) be pleased also to remember, that now if you be not also passionate and devout for the things you mention, you Page  122 will want the Spirit of prayer, and be more inexcusable than before. In many of your prayers before (especially the publique) you heard a voice but saw and perceived nothing of the sense, and what you under∣stood of it was like the man in the Gos∣pel that was half blind, he saw men walk∣ing like Trees, and so you possibly might perceive the meaning of it in general; You knew where they came to the Epistle, when to the Gospel, when the Introit, when the Pax, when any of the other more general periods were; but you could have nothing of the Spirit of prayer, that is, nothing of the devotion and the holy affections to the particular excellencies which could or ought there to have been represented, but now you are taught how you may be really devout, it is made facil and easie, and there can want nothing but your consent and observation. 2. Whereas now you are taken off from all humane confidences, from rely∣ing wholly and almost ultimately upon the Priests power and external act, from reck∣oning prayers by numbers, from forms and out-sides, you are not to think that Page  123 the Priests power is less, that the Sacra∣ments are not effective, that your prayers may not be repeated frequently; but you are to remember, that all outward things and Ceremonies, all Sacraments and Insti∣tutions work their effect in the vertue of Christ, by some moral Instrument; The Priests in the Church of England can ab∣solve you as much as the Roman Priests could fairly pretend; but then we teach that you must first be a penitent and a re∣turning person, and our absolution does but manifest the work of God, and com∣fort and instruct your Conscience, direct and manage it; You shall be absolved here, but not unless you live an holy life; So that in this you will find no change but to the advantage of a strict life; we will not flatter you and cozen your dear soul by pretended ministeries, but we so order our discourses and directions that all our mini∣strations may be really effective, and when you receive the holy Sacrament of the Eu∣charist, or the Lords Supper, it does more good here than they do there, because if they consecrate rightly, yet they do not communicate you fully; and if they offer the whole representative Sacrifice, yet they Page  124 do not give you the whole Sacrament; only we enjoyn that you come with so much holiness, that the grace of God in your heart may be the principal, and the Sacrament in our hands may be the mini∣string and assisting part: we do not pro∣mise great effects to easie trifling disposi∣tions, because we would not deceive, but really procure to you great effects; and therefore you are now to come to our of∣fices with the same expectations as before, of pardon, of grace, of sanctification; but you must do something more of the work your self, that we may not do less in effect than you have in your expectation; We will not to advance the reputation of our power deceive you into a less bles∣sing. 3. Be careful that you do not flatter your self, that in our Communion you may have more ease and liberty of life; for though I know your pious soul desires passionately to please God and to live re∣ligiously, yet I ought to be careful to pre∣vent a temptation, lest it at any time should discompose your severity: Therefore as to confession to a Priest (which how it is Page  125 usually practised among the Roman party, your self can very well account, and you have complain'd sadly, that it is made an ordinary act, easie and transient, some∣time matter of temptation, oftentimes impertinent, but) suppose it free from such scandal to which some mens folly did betray it, yet the same severity you'l find among us; for though we will not tell a lie to help a sinner, and say that is neces∣sary which is only appointed to make men do themselves good, yet we advise and commend it, and do all the work of souls to all those people that will be saved by all means; to devout persons, that make Religion the business of their lives, and they that do not so in the Churches of the Roman Communion, as they find but little advantage by periodical confessi∣ons, so they feel but little awfulness and severity by the injunction; you must con∣fess to God all your secret actions, you must advise with a holy man in all the af∣fairs of your soul, you will be but an ill friend to your self if you conceal from him the state of your spiritual affairs: We de∣sire not to hear the circumstance of every sin, but when matter of justice is concern∣ed Page  126 or the nature of the sin is changed, that is, when it ought to be made a Que∣stion; and you will find that though the Church of England gives you much liberty from the bondage of innumerable Cere∣monies and humane devices, yet in the matter of holiness you will be tied to very great service, but such a service as is per∣fect freedom, that is, the service of God and the love of the holy Jesus, and a very strict religious life; for we do not pro∣mise heaven, but upon the same terms it is promised us, that is, Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus: and as in faith we make no more to be necessary than what is made so in holy Scripture, so in the matter of Repentance we give you no easie devices, and suffer no lessening definitions of it, but oblige you to that strictness which is the condition of being saved, and so expressed to be by the infal∣lible Word of God; but such as in the Church of Rome they do not so much stand upon. Madam, I am weary of my Journey, and although I did purpose to have spoken many things more, yet I desire that my Page  127 not doing it may be laid upon the account of my weariness, all that I shall add to the main business is this. 4. Read the Scripture diligently, and with an humble spirit, and in it observe what is plain, and believe and live accord∣ingly. Trouble not your self with what is difficult, for in that your duty is not de∣scribed. 5. Pray frequently and effectually; I had rather your prayers should be often than long. It was well said of Petrarch, Magno verborum fraeno uti decet cum su∣periore colloquentem. When you speak to your Superior you ought to have a bridle upon your tongue, much more when you speak to God. I speak of what is decent in respect of our selves and our infinite distances from God: but if love makes you speak, speak on, so shall your pray∣ers be full of charity and devotion, Nul∣lus est amore superior, ille te coget ad ve∣niam, qui me ad multiloquium; Love makes God to be our friend, and our approches more united and acceptable; and there∣fore you may say to God, the same love Page  128 which made me speak, will also move thee to hear and pardon: Love and devotion may enlarge your Litanies, but nothing else can, unless Authority does interpose. 6. Be curious not to communicate but with the true Sons of the Church of Eng∣land, lest if you follow them that were amongst us, but are gone out from us, because they were not of us) you be of∣fended and tempted to impute their follies to the Church of England. 7. Trouble your self with no contro∣versies willingly, but how you may best please God by a strict and severe con∣versation. 8. If any Protestant live loosely, re∣member that he dishonours an excellent Religion, and that it may be no more laid upon the charge of our Church, than the ill lives of most Christians may upon the whole Religion. 9. Let no Man or Woman affright you with declamations and scaring words of Heretick, and Damnation, and Changeable; Page  129 for these words may be spoken against them that return to light, as well as to those that go to darkness, and that which Men of all sides can say, it can be of ef∣fect to no side upon its own strength or pretension. THE END.  Page  130POST-SCRIPT.Madam, IF You shall think it fit that these Pa∣pers pass further than Your own eye and Closet, I desire they may be con∣sign'd into the hands of my worthy friend Dr. Wedderburne: For I do not only expose all my sickness to his cure, but I submit my weaknesses to his censure, being as confident to find of him charity for what is pardonable, as remedy for what is curable: but indeed Madam I look upon that worthy Man as an Idea of friendship, and if I had no other notices of Friendship or conversa∣tion to instruct me than his, it were suffici∣ent: For whatsoever I can say of Friend∣ship. I can say of his, and as all that know him reckon him amongst the best Physicians, so I know him worthy to be reckoned amongst the best friends.    Page  131The III. Letter. Written to a Gentleman that was tempted to the Com∣munion of the Romish Church. SIR, YOU needed not to make the Preface of an excuse for wri∣ting so friendly, and so neces∣sary a Letter of Inquiry. It was your kindness to my person which di∣rected your addresses hither; and your duty which ingag'd you to inquire some∣where. I do not doubt but you, and very many other ingenious and conscientious persons, Page  132 do every day meet with the Tempters of the Roman Church, who like the Pharisees compass Sea and Land to get a Proselyte; at this I wonder not; for as Demetrius said, by this craft they get their living: but I wonder that any ingenious person, and such as I perceive you to be, can be shaken by their weak assaults: for their batteries are made up with impossible propositions, and weak and violent preju∣dices respectively; and when they talk of their own infallibility, they prove it with false Mediums (say we) with fallible Me∣diums as themselves confess; and when they argue us of an Uncertain faith, be∣cause we pretend to no infallibility, they are themselves much more Uncertain, be∣cause they build their pretence of infalli∣bility upon that which not only can, but will deceive them: and since they can pre∣tend no higher for their infallibility than prudential motives, they break in pieces the staff upon which they lean, and with which they strike us. But Sir, you are pleased to ask two Questions. 1. Whether the Apostles of our Blessed Lord did not Orally deliver Page  133 many things necessary to Salvation which were not committed to writing? To which you add this assumentum, (in which because you desire to be answered, I suppose you meant it for another Question) viz. whe∣ther in those things which the Church of Rome retains, and we take no notice of, She be an Innovator, or a conserver of Tradition; and whether any thing which she so retains was or was not esteemed ne∣cessary? The answer to the first part, will con∣clude the second. I therefore answer, that whatsoever the Apostles did deliver as ne∣cessary to Salvation, all that was written in the Scriptures: and that to them who believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God, there needs no other Magazine of Divine truths but the Scripture. And this the Fathers of the first and divers suc∣ceeding Ages do Unanimously affirm. I will set down two or three, so plain that either you must conclude them to be de∣ceivers, or that you will need no more but their testimony. Page  134The words of S. Basil are these,*〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, &c. Every word and every thing ought to be made credible, or be∣liev'd by the testimony of the Divinely-inspired Scripture: both for the confirma∣tion of good things, and also for the re∣proof of the evil. S. Cyril of Jerusalem, catech. 12. illu∣minat. saith, Attend not to my inventions, for you may possibly be deceiv'd: but trust no word unless thou dost learn it from the Divine Scriptures: and in Catech. 4. illum.〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, &c. For it behoves us not to deliver so much as the least thing 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, of the Divine and holy mysteries of Faith without the Divine Scriptures, nor to be moved with probable discour∣ses: Neither give credit to me speaking, unless what is spoken be demonstrated by the Holy Scriptures. For that is the secu∣rity of our Faith, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, which is derived not from witty inventi∣ons, but from the demonstration of Divine Scriptures. Page  135Omne quod loquimur debemus affirmare de Scripturis Sanctis: so S. Hierom in Psal. 89. And again, Hoc quia de Scripturis authoritatem non habet, eadem facilitate contemnitur quâ probatur, in Matth. 23. Si quid dicitur absque Scripturâ audito∣rum cogitatio claudicat. So S. Chrysostom in Psal. 95. homil. Theodoret, dial. 1. cap. 6. brings in the Orthodox Christian saying to Eranistes: bring not to me your Logismes and Syllo∣gismes, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. I rely only upon Scriptures. I could reckon very, very many more, both el∣der and later: and if there be any Univer∣sal Tradition consigned to us by the Uni∣versal Testimony of Antiquity: it is this, that the Scriptures are a perfect repository of all the Will of God, of all the Faith of Christ: and this I will engage my self to make very apparent to you, and certain against any opposer. Upon the supposition of which it fol∣lows, that whatever the Church of RomePage  136 obtrudes as necessary to Salvation, and an Article of Faith that is not in Scripture, is an Innovation in matter of Faith, and a Tyranny over Consciences: which who∣soever submits to, prevaricates the rule of the Apostle, commanding us, that we stand fast in the liberty, with which Christ hath set us free. To the other Questions; Whether an Ecclesiastical Tradition be of equal autho∣rity with Divine? I answer Negatively: And I believe I shall have no adversary in it, except peradventure some of the Jesui∣ted Bigots. An Ecclesiastical Tradition, viz. a positive constitution of the Church delivered from hand to hand; is in the power of the Church to alter: but a Di∣vine is not. Ecclesiastical Traditions in matters of Faith there are none, but what are also Divine; as for Rituals Ecclesia∣stical descending by Tradition, they are confessedly alterable: but till they be al∣tered by abrogation, or desuetude, or contrary custome, or a contrary reason, or the like, they do oblige by vertue of that Authority whatsoever it is that hath power over you. I know not what D. Page  137P. G. did say, but I am confident they who reported it of him, were mistaken: He could not say or mean what is char∣ged upon him. I have but two things more to speak to. One is, you desire me to recite what else might impede your compli∣ance with the Roman Church? I answer, Truth and Piety hinder you. For you must profess the belief of many false propositions, and certainly believe many Uncertain things, and be uncharitable to all the World but your own party, and make Christianity a faction, and you must yield your reason a servant to man, and you must plainly prevaricate an in∣stitution of Christ, and you must make an apparent departure from the Church in which you received your Baptism and the Spirit of God, if you go over to Rome. But Sir, I refer you to the two Letters I have lately published at the end of my discourse of Friendship; and I desire you to read my Treatise of the Real presence: and if you can believe the doctrine of Transubstantiati∣on, you can put off your reason and Page  138 your sense, and your religion, and all the instruments of Credibility when you please: and these are not little things; In these you may perish: an error in these things is practical; but our way is safe, as being upon the defence, and intirely resting upon Scripture, and the Apostolical Churches. The other thing I am to speak to is, the report you have heard of my in∣clinations to go over to Rome. Sir, that party which needs such lying sto∣ries for the support of their Cause, proclaim their Cause to be very weak, or themselves to be very evil Advo∣cates. Sir, be confident, they dare not tempt me to do so, and it is not the first time they have endeavoured to serve their ends by saying such things of me. But I bless God for it; it is perfectly a Slander, and it shall I hope, for ever prove so. Sir, if I may speak with you, I shall say very many things more for your confirmation. Pray to God to guide you; and make no change sud∣denly: For if their way be true to day, it will be so to morrow; and you need Page  139 not make hast to undo your self. Sir, I wish you a setled mind and a holy Conscience; and that I could serve you in the capacity of Your very Loving Friend and Servant in our Blessed Lord, JER. TAYLOR.   Page  [unnumbered]Page  141The IV. LETTER. To the same Person. SIR, I Perceive that You are very much troubled; and I see also that you are in great danger; but that also trou∣bles me, because I see they are little things and very weak and fallacious that move you. You propound many things in your Letter in the same disorder as they are in your Conscience: to all which I can best give answers when I speak with you; to which because you desire, I invite you, and promise you a hearty endeavour to give you satisfaction in all your material inquiries. Sir, I desire you to make no hast to change, in case you be so miserable as to have it in your thoughts: for to go over to the Church of Rome is like death, Page  142 there is no recovery from thence without a Miracle; because Unwary souls (such are they who change from us to them) are with all the arts of wit and violence strangely entangled and ensur'd, when they once get the prey. Sir, I thank you for the Paper you inclosed. The men are at a loss, they would fain say something against that Book, but know not what. Sir, I will endeavour if you come to me, to restore you to peace and quiet; and if I cannot effect it, yet I will pray for it, and I am sure, God can. To his Mercy I commend you and rest Your very affectionate Friend in our Blessed Lord, JER. TAYLOR.   Page  143The V. LETTER. To the same Person. SIR, THE first Letter which you men∣tion in this latter of the 10th, of March, I received not; I had not else failed to give you an an∣swer; I was so wholly unknowing of it, that I did not understand your Servant's meaning when he came to require an an∣swer. But to your Question which you now propound, I answer. Quest. Whether without all danger of Superstition or Idolatry we may not ren∣der Divine worship to our Blessed Saviour, as present in the Blessed Sacrament or Host, according to his Humane Nature in that Host? Page  144Answ. We may not render Divine worship to him (as present in the Blessed Sacrament according to his Humane Na∣ture) without danger of Idolatry: Be∣cause he is not there according to his Hu∣mane Nature, and therefore, you give Divine worship to a Non Ens, which must needs be Idolatry. For Idolum nihil est in mundo, saith S. Paul, and Christ as pre∣sen•: by his Humane Nature in the Sacra∣ment is a Non Ens; for it is not true, there is no such thing. He is present there by his Divine power, and his Di∣vine Blessing, and the fruits of his Body, the real effective consequents of his Pas∣sion: but for any other Presence, it is Idolum, it is nothing in the world. Adore Christ in Heaven; for the Heavens must contain him till the time of restitution of all things. And if you in the reception of the Holy Sacrament worship him whom you know to be in Heaven; you cannot be concerned in duty to worship him in the Host (as you call it) any more than to worship him in the Host at Nostre Dame when you are at S. Peters in Rome: for you see him no more in one place than Page  145 another; and if to believe him to be there in the Host at Nostre Dame be sufficient to cause you to worship him there, then you are to do so to him at Rome, though you be not present: for you believe him there; you know as much of Him by Faith in both places, and as little by sense in either. But however, this is a thing of infinite dan∣ger. God is a jealous God: He spake it in the matter of external worship, and of idolatry; and therefore do nothing that is like worshipping a meer crea∣ture, nothing that is like worshipping that which you are not sure it is God: and if you can believe the Bread when it is blessed by the Priest is God Al∣mighty, you can if you please believe any thing else. To the other parts of your Question, viz. Whether the same body be present really and Substantially, because we be∣lieve it to be there; or whether we do believe it to be there because God hath manifestly revealed it to be so, and therefore we revere and adore it ac∣cordingly. Page  146I answer, 1. I do not know whether or no you do believe Him to be there really and Substantially. 2. If you do believe it so, I do not know what you mean by really and Substantially. 3. Whatsoever you do mean by it, if you do believe it to be there really and Sub∣stantially in any sense, I cannot tell why you believe it to be so: you best know your own reasons and motives of belief; for my part, I believe it to be there really in the sense I have explicated in my Book; and for those reasons which I have there alledged; but that we are to adore it upon that account, I no way understand. If it be Transubstantiated and you are sure of it: then you may pray to it, and put your trust in it; and believe the Holy Bread to be co∣eternal with the Father, and with the Holy Ghost. But it is strange that the Bread being consecrated by the power of the Holy Ghost, should be turn'd into the substance and nature of God, and of the Son of God: if so, does not the Son at that time proceed from the Holy Ghost, and not the Holy Ghost Page  147 from the Son? But I am ashamed of the horrible proposition. Sir, I pray God keep you from these extremest dangers. I love and value you, and will pray for you and be, Dear Sir, Your very affectionate Friend to serve you, JER. TAYLOR.   Page  [unnumbered]Page  [unnumbered]A DISCOURSE PROVING THAT THE Christian Religion IS FROM GOD.   Page  [unnumbered]Page  [unnumbered]Mr. Royston, 'TIs reported You are making a new Impression of some small Tracts of Doctor Taylor, the late most Reverend Bishop of Down; It will be very advisable for You to take the Demonstration of Christian Religion, which is inserted in his Cases of Conscience, pag. 124. of the first Edition, and let that fol∣low the rest; For 'tis a Discourse which will be as useful for the ge∣nerality of People in this Age, as any You can pick out of the whole Body of his Works; and being here∣tofore inserted in the middle of a large Page  [unnumbered] Book, is not made so common to them, nor so purchaseable, as your pursuing this design will render it; and hereby you will do a work very acceptable to the Friends of Christian Truth and Vertue, as well as to Yours A. B.   Page  153A DISCOURSE PROVING THAT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS FROM GOD. THis Discourse of all the disputables in the World, shall require the fewest things to be granted; even nothing but what was evident, even no∣thing but the very subject of the Question, viz. That there was such a Man as Jesus Christ, that he pretended such things and taught such Doctrines: for he that will prove these things to be from God, must be allowed that they were from something Page  154 or other. But this postulate I do not ask for need, but for orders sake and Art; for what the Histories of that Age reported as a publick affair, as one of the most emi∣nent transactions of the World, that which made so much noise, which caused so many changes, which occasioned so many Wars, which divided so many hearts, which alter∣ed so many families, which procured so many deaths, which obtained so many Laws in favour, and suffered so many Rescripts in the disfavour of its self; that which was not done in a corner, but was 33. Years and more in acting; which caused so many Sects, and was opposed by so much Art, and so much power that it might not grow, which filled the World with noise, which effected such great changes in the bodies of Men by curing the diseased, and smiting the contumacious or the hypocrites, which drew so many eyes, and fill'd so many tongues, and imployed so many pens, and was the care and the question of the whole World at that time, and immediately after; that which was consigned by publick acts and records of Courts, which was in the Books of friends and enemies, which came accompanied and remarked with Eclipses Page  155 and Stars and Prodigies of Heaven and Earth, that which the Jews even in spite and against their wills confessed, and which the witty adversaries intending to over∣throw, could never so much as challenge of want of truth in the matter of fact and sto∣ry; that which they who are infinitely con∣cerned that it should not be believed, or more, that it had never been, do yet only labour to make to appear not to have been Divine: Certainly, this thing is so certain that it was, that the defenders of it need not account it a kindness to have it presup∣posed; for never was any story in the world that had so many degrees of credi∣bility, as the story of the person, life and death of Jesus Christ: And if he had not been a true Prophet, yet that he was in the world, and said and did such things cannot be denied; for even concerning Mahomet we make no question but he was in the world, and led a great part of Mankind af∣ter him, and what was less proved we infi∣nitely believe; and what all men say, and no man denies, and was notorious in it self, of this we may make further inquiries whe∣ther it was all that which it pretended, for that it did make pretences and was in the Page  156 world, needs no more probation. But now whether Jesus Christ was sent from God and delivered the Will of God, we are to take accounts from all the things of the world which were on him, or about him, or from him. Consider first his per∣son: he was foretold by all the Prophets: He, I say, for that appears by the event, and the correspondencies of their sayings to his person: he was described by infalli∣ble characterisms which did fit him, and did never fit any but him; for when he was born, then was the fulness of time, and the Messias was expected at the time when Je∣sus did appear, which gave occasion to many of the godly then to wait for him, and to hope to live till the time of his revelation: and they did so, and with a spirit of Pro∣phecy which their own Nation did confess and honour, glorified God at the revelati∣on: and the most excellent and devout per∣sons that were conspicuous for their piety did then rejoyce in him, and confess him; and the expectation of him at that time was so publick and famous, that it gave occasion to divers Impostors to abuse the credulity of the people in pretending to be the Messi∣as; but not only the predictions of the Page  157 time, and the perfect Synchronisms did point him out, but at his birth a strange Star ap∣peared, which guided certain Levantine Princes and Sages to the inquiry after him; a strange Star which had an irregular place and an irregular motion, that came by de∣sign, and acted by counsel, the counsel of the Almighty Guide, it moved from place to place, till it stood just over the House where the Babe did sleep; a Star of which the Heathen knew much, who knew no∣thing of him; a Star which Chalcidius af∣firmed to have signified the descent of God for the salvation of Man; a Star that gui∣ded the wise Chaldees to worship him with gifts (as the same disciple of Plato does af∣firm, and) as the holy Scriptures deliver; and this Star could be no secret; It trou∣bled all the Country; It put Herod upon strange arts of security for his Kingdom, it effected a sad tragedy accidentally, for it occasioned the death of all the little Babes in the City, and voisinage of Bethlehem: But the birth of this young Child which was thus glorified by a Star, was also signi∣fied by an Angel, and was effected by the holy Spirit of God, in a manner which was in it self supernatural; a Virgin was his Page  158 Mother, and God was his Father, and his beginning was miraculous; and this matter of his birth of a Virgin was proved to an interested and jealous person, even to Joseph the supposed father of Jesus, it was affirmed publickly by all his family, and by all his dis∣ciples, and published in the midst of all his enemies, who by no artifice could reprove it, a matter so famous, that when it was ur∣ged as an argument to prove Jesus to be the Messias, by the force of a Prophecy in Isaiah [A Virgin shall conceive a Son] they who obstinately refused to admit him, did not deny the matter of fact, but denied that it was so meant by the Prophet, which if it were true, can only prove that Jesus was more excellent than was foretold by the Prophets, but that there was nothing less in him than was to be in the Messias; it was a matter so famous that the Arabian Phy∣sicians who can affirm no such things of their Mahomet, and yet not being able to deny it to be true of the Holy Jesus, endeavour to elevate and lessen the thing, by saying, It is not wholly beyond the force of na∣ture, that a Virgin should conceive, so that it was on all hands undeniable, that the Mother of Jesus was a Virgin, a Mother Page  159 without a Man. This is that Jesus at whose presence before he was born, a Babe in his Mothers belly also did leap for joy, who was also a person extraordinary himself, con∣ceived in his Mothers old age, after a long barrenness, signified by an Angel in the Temple, to his Father officiating his Priest∣ly Office, who was also struck dumb for his not present believing: all the People saw it, and all his Kindred were witnesses of his re∣stitution, and he was named by the Angel, and his Office declared to be the fore-run∣ner of the holy Jesus; and this also was foretold by one of the old Prophets; for the whole story of this Divine person is a chain of providence and wonder, every link of which is a verification of a Prophecy, and all of it is that thing which from Adam to the Birth of Jesus was pointed at and hinted by all the Prophets, whose words in him passed perfectly into the event. This is that Jesus who as he was born with∣out a Father, so he was learned without a Master, he was a Man without age, a Doctor in a Child's garment, disputing in the Sanctuary at 12. Years old. He was a sojourner in Egypt, because the poor Babe born of an indigent Mother was a formida∣ble Page  160 rival to a potent King, and this fear could not come from the design of the Infant, but must needs arise from the illustriousness of the Birth, and the Prophecies of the Child, and the sayings of the Learned, and the journey of the Wise-men, nd the decrees of God; this journey and the return were both managed by the conduct of an Angel and a Divine dream, for to the Son of God all the Angels did rejoyce to minister. This Blessed Person made thus excellent by his Father, and glorious by miraculous consig∣nations, and illustrious by the ministery of Heavenly spirits, and proclaimed to Mary and to Joseph by two Angels, to the Shep∣herds by a Multitude of the Heavenly Host, to the Wise men by a Prophecy and by a Star, to the Jews by the Shepherds, to the Gentiles by the three Wise men, to Herod by the Doctors of the Law, and to him∣self perfectly known by the inchasing his humane nature in the bosom and heart of God, and by the fulness of the Spirit of God, was yet pleased for 30. Years together to live an humble, a laborious, a chast and a de∣vout, a regular and an even, a wise and an exemplar, a pious and an obscure life, with∣out complaint, without sin, without design Page  161 of fame, or grandeur of spirit, till the time came that the clefts of the rock were to o∣pen, and the Diamond give its lustre, and be worn in the Diadems of Kings, and then this Person was wholly admirable; for he was ushered into the World by the voice of a loud Crier in the Wilderness, a Person au∣stere and wise, of a strange life, full of ho∣liness and full of hardness, and a great Prea∣cher of righteousness, a Man believed by all the People that he came from God, one who in his own Nation gathered Disciples publickly, and (which amongst them was a great matter) he was the Doctor of a new institution, and baptized all the Country; yet this man so great, so rever'd, so followed, so listned to by King and People, by Doctors and by ideots, by Pharisees and Sadducees, this man preached Jesus to the People, poin∣ted out the Lamb of God, told that he must increase, and himself from all that fame must retire to give him place; he re∣ceived him to Baptism after having with du∣ty and modesty declared his own unworthi∣ness to give, but rather a worthiness to re∣ceive Baptism from the holy hands of Jesus; but at the solemnity God sent down the holy Spirit upon his holy Son, and by a Page  162 voice from Heaven, a voice of thunder (and God was in that voice) declared that this was his Son, and that he was delighted in him. This voice from Heaven was such, so evident, so certain a conviction of what it did intend to prove, so known and accep∣ted as the way of Divine revelation under the second Temple, that at that time every Man that desired a sign honestly, would have been satisfied with such a voice; it be∣ing the testimony by which God made all extraordinaries to be credible to his Peo∣ple from the days of Ezra, to the death of the Nation; and that there was such a voice, not only then, but divers times after, was as certain, and made as evident as things of that nature can ordinarily be made. For it being a matter of fact, cannot be suppo∣sed infinite, but limited to time and place, heard by a certain number of persons, and was as a clap of Thunder upon ordinary accounts, which could be heard but by those who were within the sphere of its own activity; and reported by those to others, who are to give testimony as testimonies are required, which are credible under the test of two or three disinterested, honest, and true Men, and though this was done Page  163 in the presence of more, and oftner than once, yet it was a divine testimony but at first, but is to be conveyed by the means of Men; and as God thundred from Heaven at the giving of the Law, though that he did so, we have notice only from the Books of Moses received from the Jewish Nation; so he did in the days of the Baptist, and so he did to Peter, James, and John, and so he did in the presence of the Pharisees and ma∣ny of the common People; and as it is not to be supposed that all these would joyn their divided interests, for and against them∣selves for the verification of a lye, so if they would have done it, they could not have done it without reproof of their own par∣ties, who would have been glad by the dis∣covery only to disgrace the whole story; but if the report of honest and just men so reputed, may be questioned for matter of fact, or may not be accounted sufficient to make faith when there is no pretence of Men to the contrary, besides that we can have no story transmitted to us, nor Re∣cords kept, no acts of Courts, no narratives of the days of old, no traditions of our Fa∣thers; so there could not be left in nature any usual Instrument whereby God could Page  164 after the manner of Men declare his own will to us, but either we should never know the will of Heaven upon earth, or it must be that God must not only tell it once but always, and not only always to some men, but always to all men; and then as there would be no use of History, or the honesty of Men, and their faithfulness in telling any act of God in declaration of his will, so there would be perpetual necessity of mi∣racles, and we could not serve God directly with our understanding, for there would be no such thing as faith, that is, of assent without conviction of understanding, and we could not please God with believing, because there would be in it nothing of the will, nothing of love and choice; and that faith which is, would be like that of Tho∣mas, to believe what we see or hear, and God should not at all govern upon Earth unless he did continually come himself: for thus, all Government, all Teachers, all Apostles, all Messengers would be needless, because they could not shew to the eye what they told to the ears of Men; And it might as well be disbelieved in all Courts and by all Princes, that this was not the letter of a Prince, or the act of a Man, or the wri∣ting Page  165 of his hand, and so all humane enter∣course must cease, and all senses but the eye be useless as to this affair, or else to the ear all voices must be strangers but the principal, if I say, no reports shall make faith: But it is certain, that when these voi∣ces were sent from Heaven and heard upon Earth, they prevailed amongst many that heard them not, and Disciples were multi∣plied upon such accounts, or else it must be that none that did hear them could be be∣lieved by any of their friends and neigh∣bours; for if they were, the voice was as ef∣fective at the reflex and rebound as in the direct emission, & could prevail with them that believed their brother or their friend, as certainly as with them that believed their own ears and eyes. I need not speak of the vast numbers of miracles which he wrought; miracles which were not more demonstrations of his power than of his mercy; for they had nothing of pompousness and ostentation, but infinitely of charity and mercy, and that permanent and lasting and often: he opened the eyes of the blind, he made the crooked straight, he made the weak strong, he cured fevers with the touch of his hand, and an issue of Page  166 blood with the hem of his garment, and sore eyes with the spittle of his mouth and the clay of the earth; he multiplied the loaves and fishes, he raised the dead to life, a young maiden, the widows son of Naim, and Lazarus, and cast out Devils by the word of his mouth, which he could never do but by the power of God. For Satan does not cast out Satan, nor a house fight against it self, if it means to stand long, and the Devil could not help Jesus, be∣cause the holy Jesus taught Men virtue, called them from the worshipping Devils, taught them to resist the Devil, to lay aside all those abominable idolatries by which the Devil doth rule in the hearts of men: he taught men to love God, to fly from tem∣ptations to sin, to hate and avoid all those things of which the Devil is guilty, for Christianity forbids pride, envy, malice, ly∣ing, and yet affirms that the Devil is proud, envious, malicious, and the Father of lies; and therefore where ever Christianity pre∣vails, the Devil is not worshipped, and there∣fore he that can think that a man without the power of God could over-turn the De∣vils principles, cross his designs, weaken his strengths, baffle him in his policies, befool Page  167 him and turn him out of possession, and make him open his own mouth against him∣self as he did often, and confess himself con∣quered by Jesus and tormented, as the O∣racle did to Augustus Caesar, and the Devil to Jesus himself, he I say, that thinks a meer man can do this, knows not the weaknesses of a man, nor the power of an Angel; but he that thinks this could be done by compact, and by consent of the Devil, must think him to be an Intelligence without understanding, a power without force, a fool and a sot to assist a power against himself, and to per∣secute the power he did assist, to stir up the World to destroy the Christians, whose Master and Lord he did assist to destroy himself; and when we read that Porphyrius an Heathen, a professed enemy to Christi∣anity, did say, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉,* that since Jesus was worshipped, the gods could help no man, that is, the gods which they worshipped; the poor baffled enervated Daemons: He must either think that the Devils are as foolish as they are weak, or else that they did nothing towards this de∣clination of their power; and therefore Page  168 that they suffer it by a power higher than themselves, that is, by the power of God in the hand of Jesus. But besides that God gave testimony from heaven concerning him; he also gave this testimony of himself to have come from God, because that he did Gods will; for he that is a good man and lives by the Laws of God and of his Nation, a life innocent and simple, prudent and wise, holy and spot∣less, unreproved and unsuspected, he is certainly by all wise men said in a good sense to be the son of God, but he who does well and speaks well, and calls all men to glorifie and serve God, and serves no ends but of holiness and charity, of wisdom of hearts and reformation of manners, this man carries great authority in his sayings, and ought to prevail with good men in good things, for good ends, which is all that is here required. But his nature was so sweet, his manners so humble, his words so wise and composed, his comportment so grave and winning, his answers so sea∣sonable, his questions so deep, his reproof so severe and charitable, his pity so great and merciful, his preachings so full of reason and holiness, of weight and authority, his Page  169 conversation so useful and beneficent, his poverty great but his alms frequent, his family so holy and religious, his and their imployment so profitable, his meekness so incomparable, his passions without diffe∣rence, save only where zeal or pity carried him on to worthy and apt expressions, a person that never laughed, but often wept in a sense of the calamities of others; he loved every man and hated no man, he gave counsel to the doubtful, and instructed the ignorant, he bound up the broken hearts, and strengthened the feeble knees, he relieved the poor, and converted the sin∣ners, he despised none that came to him for relief, and as for those that did not he went to them; he took all occasions of mercy that were offered him, and went abroad for more; he spent his days in Preaching and healing, and his nights in Prayers and conversation with God, he was obedient to Laws and subject to Princes, though he was the Prince of Judaea in right of his Mo∣ther, and of all the World in right of his Father; the People followed him, but he made no conventions, and when they were made, he suffered no tumults, when they would have made him a King he withdrew Page  170 himself, when he knew they would put him to death he offered himself; he knew mens hearts, and conversed secretly, and gave answer to their thoughts and preven∣ted their questions; he would work a mi∣racle rather than give offence, and yet suf∣fer every offence rather than see God his Father dishonored, he exactly kept the Law of Moses, to which he came to put a pe∣riod, and yet chose to signify his purpose onely by doing acts of mercy upon their Sabbath, doing nothing which they should call a breach of a Commandment, but heal∣ing sick people, a charity which themselves would do to beasts, and yet they were angry at him for doing it to their bre∣thren: In all his life, and in all his conver∣sation with his Nation, he was innocent as an Angel of light, and when by the great∣ness of his worth, and the severity of his do∣ctrine, and the charity of his miracles, and the noises of the people, and his immense fame in all that part of the World, and the multitude of his disciples, and the authority of his Sermons, and his free reproof of their hypocrisie, and his discovery of their false doctrines and weak traditions, he had branded the reputation of the vicious Ru∣lers Page  171 of the People, and they resolved to put him to death, they who had the biggest ma∣lice in the World, and the weakest accusa∣tions were forced to supply their want of articles against him by making truth to be his fault, and his office to be his crime, and his open confession of what was asked him to be his article of condemnation, and yet after all this they could not perswade the competent Judge to condemn him, or to find him guilty of any fault, and there∣fore they were forced to threaten him with Caesar's name, against whom then they would pretend him to be an enemy, though in their charge they neither proved, nor in∣deed laid it against him, and yet to whatso∣ever they objected he made no return, but his silence and his innocence were remark∣able and evident, without labour and reply, and needed no more argument than the Sun needs an advocate to prove that he is the brightest star in the firmament. Well, so it was, they crucified him, and when they did they did as much put out the eye of heaven as destroy the Son of God; for when with an incomparable sweetness, and a patience exemplar to all ages of suf∣ferers, he endured affronts, examinations, Page  172 scorns, insolencies of rude ungentle Trades∣men, cruel whippings, injurious, unjust and unreasonable usages from those whom he obliged by all the arts of endearment and offers of the biggest kindness, at last he went to death as to the work which God appointed him that he might become the Worlds sacrifice, and the great example of holiness, and the instance of representing by what way the World was to be made happy [even by sufferings and so entring into heaven] that he might (I say) become the Saviour of his Enemies, and the Elder Brother to his friends, and the Lord of Glo∣ry, and the fountain of its emanation. Then it was that God gave new testimonies from Heaven; The Sun was eclipsed all the while he was upon the Cross, and yet the Moon was in the full; that is, he lost his light, not because any thing in nature did invest him, but because the God of nature (as a Heathen at that very time confessed, who yet saw nothing of this sad iniquity) did suffer. The rocks did rend, the veil of the Temple divided of it self and opened the inclosures, and disparked the Sanctua∣ry, and made it pervious to the Gentiles eye; the dead arose, and appeared in Jeru∣salemPage  173 to their friends, the Centurion and divers of the People smote their hearts, and were by these strange indications con∣vinced that he was the Son of God. His garments were parted, and lots cast upon his inward coat, they gave him vinegar and gall to drink, they brake not a bone of him, but they pierced his side with a Spear, looking upon him whom they had pierced; according to the Prophecies of him, which were so clear and descended to minutes and circumstances of his passion, that there was nothing left by which they could doubt whether this were he or no who was to come into the World: But after all this, that all might be finally verified and no scruple left, after three days burial, a great stone being rolled to the face of the grave and the stone sealed, and a Guard of Soul∣diers placed about it, he arose from the grave, and for forty days together conver∣sed with his followers and Disciples, and be∣yond all suspicion was seen of 500. Bre∣thren at once, which is a number too great to give their consent and testimony to a lye, and it being so publickly and confidently affirmed at the very time it was done, and for ever after urged by all Christians, used Page  174 as the most mighty demonstration, proclai∣med, preached, talked of, even upbraided to the gain-sayers, affirmed by eye-witnes∣ses, perswaded to the kindred and friends and the relatives and companions of all those 500. persons who were eye-witnesses, it is infinitely removed from a reasonable suspicion; and at the end of those days was taken up into Heaven in the sight of many of them, as Elias was in the presence of Elisha. Now he of whom all these things are true, must needs be more than a meer man, and that they were true was affirmed by very many eye-witnesses, Men who were in∣nocent, plain men, men that had no bad ends to serve, men that looked for no prefer∣ment by the thing in this life; Men to whom their Master told they were to expect not Crowns and Scepters, not praise of men or wealthy possessions, not power and ease, but a voluntary casting away care and attendance upon secular affairs that they might attend their Ministery; poverty and prisons, trouble and vexation, persecuti∣on and labour, whippings and banishment, bonds and death, and for a reward they must stay till a good day came, but that was not Page  175 to be at all in this World; and when the day of restitution and recompence should come, they should never know till it came, but upon the hope of this and the faith of Jesus, and the Word of God so taught, so consigned, they must rely wholly and for ever. Now let it be considered, how could matters of fact be proved better? and how could this be any thing, but such as to rely upon matters of fact? what greater cer∣tainty can we have of any thing that was ever done which we saw not, or heard not, but by the report of wise and honest per∣sons? especially since they were such whose life and breeding was so far from ambition and pompousness, that as they could not na∣turally and reasonably hope for any great number of Proselytes, so the same that could be hop'd for amongst them, as it must be a matter of their own procuring, and conse∣quently uncertain, so it must needs be very inconsiderable, not fit to outweigh the dan∣ger and the loss, nor yet at all valuable by them whose education and pretences were against it? These we have plentifully. But if these Men are numerous and united, it is more. Then we have more; For so many did affirm these things which they Page  176 saw and heard, that Thousands of People were convinced of the truth of them: But then if these men offer their oath, it is yet more, but yet not so much as we have, for they sealed those things with their blood; they gave their life for a testimony; and what reward can any man expect, if he gives his life for a lye? who shall make him re∣compence, or what can tempt him to do it knowingly? But after all, it is to be re∣membred, that as God hates lying, so he hates incredulity; as we must not believe a lye, so neither stop up our eyes and ears against truth; and what we do every mi∣nute of our lives in matters of little and of great concernment, if we refuse to do in our Religion which yet is to be conducted as other humane affairs are, by humane in∣struments and arguments of perswasion proper to the nature of the thing, it is an obstinacy that is as contrary to humane rea∣son as it is to Divine faith. These things relate to the person of the holy Jesus, and prove sufficiently that it was extraordinary, that it was divine, that God was with him, that his power wrought in him; and therefore that it was his will which Jesus taught, and God signed. But Page  177 then if nothing of all this had been, yet even the doctrine it self proves it self Di∣vine and to come from God. For it is a Doctrine perfective of hu∣mane nature, that teaches us to love God and to love one another, to hurt no man, and to do good to every man, it propines to us the noblest, the highest, and the bravest plea∣sures of the World; the joys of charity, the rest of innocence, the peace of quiet spirits, the wealth of beneficence, and for∣bids us only to be beasts and to be Devils, it allows all that God and nature intended, and only restrains the excrescencies of na∣ture, and forbids us to take pleasure in that which is the only entertainment of Devils, in murders and revenges, malice and spite∣ful words and actions; it permits corporal pleasures where they can best minister to health and societies, to conversation of fa∣milies and honour of Communities, it tea∣ches men to keep their words that them∣selves may be secured in all their just inter∣ests, and to do good to others that good may be done to them; it forbids biting one another that we may not be devour'd by one another; and commands obedience to supe∣riours, that we may not be ruined in confu∣sions; Page  178 it combines Governments, and con∣firms all good Laws, and makes peace, and opposes and prevents Wars where they are not just, and where they are not neces∣sary. It is a Religion that is life and spi∣rit, not consisting in ceremonies and exter∣nal amusements, but in the services of the heart, and the real fruit of lips and hands, that is, of good words and good deeds, it bids us to do that to God which is agree∣able to his excellencies, that is, worship him with the best thing we have, and make all things else minister to it; it bids us to do that to our neighbour, by which he may be better: it is the perfection of the natural Law, and agreeable to our natural necessi∣ties, and promotes our natural ends and de∣signs: it does not destroy reason, but in∣structs it in very many things, and complies with it in all, it hath in it both heat and light; and is not more effectual than it is beauteous; it promises every thing that we can desire, and yet promises nothing but what it does effect; it proclaims war a∣gainst all vices, and generally does command every vertue; it teaches us with ease to mortifie those affections which reason durst scarce reprove, because she hath not strength Page  179 enough to conquer, and it does create in us those vertues which reason of her self ne∣ver knew, and after they are known, could never approve sufficiently: it is a doctrine in which nothing is superfluous or burden∣some, nor yet is there any thing wanting which can procure happiness to Mankind, or by which God can be glorified: and if wisdom, and mercy, and justice, and simpli∣city, and holiness, and purity, and meekness, and contentedness, and charity, be ima∣ges of God and rays of Divinity, then that Doctrine in which all these shine so glo∣riously, and in which nothing else is ingre∣dient must needs be from God; and that all this is true in the Doctrine of Jesus needs no other probation but the reading the words. For that the words of Jesus are contain∣ed in the Gospels, that is, in the writings of them, who were eye-witnesses and ear-wit∣nesses of the actions and Sermons of Jesus, is not at all to be doubted; for in every sect we believe their own records of Doctrine and institution; for it is madness to sup∣pose the Christians to pretend to be servants of the Laws of Jesus, and yet to make a Law of their own which he made not: no Page  180 man doubts but that the Alcoran is the Law of Mahomet, that the old Testament contains the Religion of the Jews; and the authority of these Books is proved by all the arguments of the Religion, for all the arguments perswading to the Religion are intended to prove no other than is contain∣ed in those Books; and these having been for 1500. years and more, received abso∣lutely by all Christian Assemblies, if any man shall offer to make a question of their authority, he must declare his reasons, for the Disciples of the Religion have suffi∣cient presumption, security and possession, till they can be reasonably disturb'd; but that now they can never be is infinitely cer∣tain, because we have a long, immemorial, universal tradition that these Books were written in those times, by those men whose Names they bear, they were accepted by all Churches at the very first notice, ex∣cept some few of the later, which were first received by some Churches, and then con∣sented to by all, they were acknowledged by the same, and by the next age for genu∣ine, their authority published, their words cited, appeals made to them in all questi∣ons of Religion, because it was known and Page  181 confessed that they wrote nothing but that they knew, so that they were not deceiv∣ed; and to say they would lie must be made to appear by something extrinsecal to this inquiry, and was never so much as plausibly pretended by any Adversaries, and it being a matter of another mans will, must be declared by actions, or not at all. But besides the men that wrote them were to be believed because they did Miracles, they wrote Prophecies, which are verified by the event, persons were cured at their Se∣pulchres, a thing so famous that it was con∣fessed even by the enemies of the Religi∣on: and after all, that which the World ought to rely upon, is the wisdom and the providence and the goodness of God; all which it concerned to take care that the Religion, which himself so adorned and proved by miracles and mighty signs, should not be lost, nor any false writings be obtru∣ded in stead of true, left without our fault the will of God become impossible to be obeyed. But to return to the thing: All those excellent things which singly did make fa∣mous so many sects of Philosophers, and re∣marked so many Princes of their sects, all them united, and many more which their Page  182 eyes 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 dark and dim could not see, are heaped together in this system of wisdom and holiness. Here are plain precepts full of deepest mystery; here are the measures of holiness and approaches to God describ'd; obedience and conformi∣ty, mortification of the body, and elevati∣ons of the spirit, abstractions from earth, and Arts of society and union with hea∣ven, degrees of excellencies, and tendences to perfection, imitations of God, and con∣versations with him; these are the heights and descents, upon the plain grounds of na∣tural reason, and natural religion, for there is nothing commanded but what our rea∣son by nature ought to choose, and yet no∣thing of natural reason taught but what is heightned and made more perfect by the Spirit of God; and when there is any thing in the Religion, that is against flesh and blood, it is only when flesh and blood is a∣gainst us, and against reason, when flesh and blood either would hinder us from great felicity, or bring us into great misery: To conclude, it is such a Law, that nothing can hinder men to receive and entertain, but a pertinacious baseness and love to vice, and none can receive it but those who resolve Page  183 to be good and excellent; and if the holy Jesus had come into the World with less splendor of power and mighty demonstra∣tions, yet even the excellency of what he taught, makes him alone fit to be the Ma∣ster of the World. But then let us consider what this excel∣lent person did effect, and with what in∣struments he brought to great things to pass. He was to put a period to the Rites of Moses, and the Religion of the Temple, of which the Jews were zealous even unto pertinacy; to reform the manners of all Mankind, to confound the wisdom of the Greeks, to break in pieces the power of the Devil to destroy the worship of all false Gods, to pull down their Oracles, and change their Laws, and by principles wise and holy to reform the false discourses of the World. But see what was to be taught, A Trinity in the Unity of the God-head, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, that is the Christian Arithmetick, Three are one and one are three, so Lucian in his Philopatris, or some other derides the Christian Doctrine; See their Philosophy, Ex nihilo nihil fit. No: Ex nihilo omnia, all things are made of nothing; and a Man God and a God Man, same per∣son Page  184 finite and infinite, born in time, and yet from all eternity, the Son of God, but yet born of a Woman, and she a Maid, but yet a Mother; resurrection of the dead, re∣union of soul and body; this was part of the Christian Physicks or their natural Phi∣losophy. But then certainly their moral was easie and delicious. It is so indeed, but not to flesh and blood, whose appetites it pretends to regulate or to destroy, to re∣strain or else to mortifie: fasting and pe∣nance, and humility, loving our enemies, resti∣tution of injuries, and self-denial, and taking up the Cross, and losing all our goods, and gi∣ving our life for Jesus: As the other was hard to believe, so this is as hard to do. But for whom and under whose conduct was all this to be believed, and all this to be done, and all this to be suffered? surely for some glorious and mighty Prince, whose splen∣dor as far out-shines the Roman Empire as the jewels of Cleopatra out-shined the swad∣ling clothes of the Babe at Bethlehem. No it was not so neither. For all this was for Jesus whom his followers preached; a poor Babe born in a stable, the son of a Car∣penter, cradled in a cratch, swadled in poor clouts; it was for him whom they indeed Page  185 call'd a God, but yet whom all the World knew, and they themselves said, was whip'd at a Post, nailed to a Cross; he fell under the malice of the Jews his Countrymen, and the power of his Roman Lords, a cheap and a pitiful sacrifice without beauty and without splendor. The design is great, but does not yet seem possible; But therefore let us see what instruments the Holy Jesus chose to effect these so mighty changes, to perswade so many propositions, to endear so great sufferings, to overcome so great enemies, to master so many impossibilities which this Doctrine and this Law from this Master were sure to meet withal. Here, here it is that the Divinity of the power is proclaimed. When a Man goes to war he raises as great an Army as he can to out-number his Enemy, but when God fights, three hundred men that lap like a dogg are sufficient; nay one word can dis∣solve the greatest army. He that means to effect any thing must have means of his own proportionable, and if they be not, he must fail, or derive them from the migh∣ty. See then with what instruments the holy Jesus sets upon this great reformation of the world. Twelve men of obscure and poor Page  186 birth, of contemptible Trades and quality, without learning, without breeding; these men were sent into the midst of a know∣ing and wise World to dispute with the most famous Philosophers of Greece, to out∣wit all the learning of Athens, to out-preach all the Roman Orators; to introduce into a newly setled Empire, which would be impa∣tient of novelties and change, such a change as must destroy all their Temples, or re∣move thence all their gods: against which change all the zeal of the World, and all the passions, and all the seeming pretences which they could make, must needs be vio∣lently opposed: a change that introduced new Laws, and caused them to reverse the old, to change that Religion under which their Fathers long did prosper, and under which the Roman Empire obtained so great a grandeur, for a Religion which in appear∣ance was silly and humble, meek and peace∣able, not apt indeed to do harm, but expo∣sing men to all the harm in the world, abate∣ing their courage, blunting their swords, teaching peace and unactiveness, and making the Souldiers arms in a manner useless, and untying their military girdle; a Religion which contradicted their reasons of State, Page  187 and erected new Judicatories, and made the Roman Courts to be silent and without causes; a Religion that gave countenance to the poor and pitiful (but in a time when riches were adored, and ambition esteemed the greatest nobleness, and pleasure thought to be the chiefest good) it brought no pe∣culiar blessing to the rich or mighty, un∣less they would become poor and humble in some real sense or other; a Religion that would change the face of things, and would also pierce into the secrets of the soul, and unravel all the intrigues of hearts, and re∣form all evil manners, and break vile ha∣bits into gentleness and counsel: that such a Religion in such a time, preached by such mean persons, should triumph over the Phi∣losophy of the World, and the arguments of the subtle, and the Sermons of the elo∣quent, and the power of Princes, and the in∣terest of States, and the inclinations of na∣ture, and the blindness of zeal, and the force of custom, and the pleasures of sin, and the busie Arts of the Devil, that is, against wit, and power, and money, and Religion, and wilfulness, and fame, and Empire, which are all the things in the World that can make a thing impossible; this I say could not be Page  188 by the proper force of such instruments; for no Man can span Heaven with an Infants palm, nor govern wise Empires with Dia∣grams. It were impudence to send a foot∣man to command Caesar to lay down his arms, to disband his legions, and throw him∣self into Tyber, or keep a Tavern next to Pom∣peys Theatre; but if a sober man shall stand alone unarm'd, undefended, or unprovided, and shall tell that he will make the Sun stand still, or remove a Mountain, or reduce Xer∣xes his Army to the scantling of a single Troop, he that believes he will and can do this, must believe he does it by a higher po∣wer than he can yet perceive, and so it was in the present transaction. For that the holy Jesus made invisible powers to do him visible honors, that his Apostles hunted the Daemons from their Tripods, their Navels, their Dens, their hollow Pipes, their Tem∣ples, and their Altars, that he made the O∣racles silent, as Lucian, Porphyrie, Celsus, and other Heathens confess; that against the order of new things, which let them be never so profitable or good do yet suffer re∣proach, and cannot prevail unless they com∣mence in a time of advantage and favour, yet that this should flourish like the Palm Page  189 by pressure, grow glorious by opposition, thrive by persecution, and was demonstra∣ted by objections, argues a higher cause than the immediate instrument; now how this higher cause did intervene is visible and notorious: The Apostles were not lear∣ned, but the holy Jesus promised that he would send down wisdom from above, from the Father of spirits; they had no power, but they should be invested with power from on high; they were ignorant and timo∣rous, but he would make them learned and confident, and so he did: he promised that in a few days he would send the holy Ghost upon them, and he did so, after ten days they felt and saw a glorious immission from hea∣ven, lights of movable fire sitting upon their heads, and that light did illuminate their hearts, and the mighty rushing wind inspi∣red them with a power of speaking divers languages, and brought to their remembran∣ces all that Jesus did and taught, and made them wise to conduct souls, and bold to venture, and prudent to advise, and pow∣erful to do miracles, and witty to convince gain-sayers, and hugely instructed in the Scriptures, and gave them the spirit of Go∣vernment, and the spirit of Prophecy. This Page  190 thing was so publick that at the first no∣tice of it three thousand souls were conver∣ted on that very day, at the very time when it was done; for it was certainly a visible demonstration of an invisible power, that ignorant persons who were never taught, should in an instant speak all the Languages of the Roman Empire; and indeed this thing was so necessary to be so, and so cer∣tain that it was so, so publick and so evident, and so reasonable, and so useful, that it is not easie to say whether it was the indication of a greater power, or a greater wisdom; and now the means was proportionable e∣nough to the biggest end; without learning they could not confute the learned World; but therefore God became their Teacher: without power they could not break the Devils violence, but therefore God gave them power; without courage they could not contest against all the violence of the Jews and Gentiles; but therefore God was their strength and gave them fortitude; without great caution and providence they could not avoid the traps of crafty Persecu∣tors, but therefore God gave them caution, and made them provident, and as Besaleel〈◊〉A•oli•h received the spirit of God, the Page  191 spirit of understanding to enable them to work excellently in the Tabernacle, so had the Apostles to make them wise for the work of God and the Ministeries of his Di∣viner Tabernacle, which God pitched, not man. Immediately upon this, the Apostles to make a fulness of demonstration and an undeniable conviction gave the spirit to others also, to Jews and Gentiles and to the Men of Samaria, and they spake with Tongues and prophesied, then they preached to all Nations, and endured all persecuti∣ons, and cured all diseases, and raised the dead to life, and were brought before Tri∣bunals, and confessed the Name of Jesus, and convinced the blasphemous Jews out of their own Prophets, and not only prevailed upon Women and weak Men, but even upon the bravest and wisest. All the disciples of John the Baptist, the Nazarens and Ebio∣nites, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, Sergius the President, Dionysius an Athe∣nian Judge, and Polycarpus, Justinus and Ire∣naeus, Athenagoras and Origen, Tertullian and Clemens of Alexandria, who could not be such fools as upon a matter not certainly true but probably false, to unravel their for∣mer principles, and to change their liberty Page  192 for a Prison, wealth for poverty, honor for disreputation, life for death, if by such ex∣change they had not been secured of truth and holiness and the will of God. But above all these was Saul, a bold and a witty, a zealous and learned young man, who going with Letters to persecute the Christians of Damascus, was by a light from Heaven called from his furious march, re∣proved by God's Angel for persecuting the cause of Jesus, was sent to the City, bapti∣zed by a Christian Minister, instructed and sent abroad, and he became the prodigy of the World for learning and zeal, for preaching and writing, for labor and suf∣ferance, for government and wisdom; he was admitted to see the holy Jesus after the Lord was taken into Heaven, he was taken up into Paradise, he conversed with Angels, he saw unspeakable rayes of glory, and besides that himself said it, who had no reason to lie, who would get nothing by it here but a conjugation of troubles, and who should get nothing by it hereafter if it were false; besides this I say, that he did all those acts of zeal and obedience for the promotion of the Religion does demon∣strate he had reason extraordinary for so Page  193 sudden a change, so strange a labour, so frequent and incomparable sufferings: and therefore as he did and suffered so much up∣on such glorious motives, so he spared not to publish it to all the world, he spake it to Kings and Princes, he told it to the envi∣ous Jews; he had partners of his journey who were witnesses of the miraculous acci∣dent, and in his publication he urged the notoriousness of the fact, as a thing not feigned, not private, but done at noon day under the Test of competent persons, and it was a thing that proved it self, for it was effective of a present, a great, and a perma∣nent change. But now it is no new wonder but a pur∣suance of the same conjugation of great and Divine things, that the Fame and Religion of Jesus was with so incredible a swiftness scattered over the face of the habitable World, from one end of the earth unto the other; it filled all Asia immediately, it pas∣sed presently to Europe, and to the furthest Africans, and all the way it went it told no∣thing but an holy and an humble story, that he who came to bring it into the world, di∣ed an ignominious death, and yet this death did not take away their courage, but added Page  194 much: for they could not fear death for that Master, whom they knew to have for their sakes suffered death, and came to life again. But now infinite numbers of persons of all sexes, and all ages, and all Countries came in to the Holy Crucifix, and he that was crucified in the reign of Tibe∣rius, was in the time of Nero, even in Rome it self, and in Nero's family by many persons esteem'd for a God; and it was upon pub∣lick record that he was so acknowledged; and this was by a Christian, Justin Martyr, urged to the Senate, and to the Emperors themselves, who if it had been otherwise could easily have confuted the bold allega∣tion of the Christian, who yet did die for that Jesus who was so speedily reputed for a God; the Cross was worn upon breasts, printed in the air, drawn upon fore-heads, carried on banners, put upon crowns Im∣perial; and yet the Christians were sought for to punishments, and exquisite punish∣ments sought forth for them; their goods were confiscate, their names odious, pri∣sons were their houses, and so many kinds of tortures invented for them that Domitius Vlpianus hath spent seven Books in describ∣ing the variety of tortures the poor Chri∣stian Page  195 was put to at his first appearing, and yet in despite of all this, and ten thousand other objections and impossibilities, what∣soever was for them made the Religion grow, and whatsoever was against them made it grow; if they had peace, the Reli∣gion was prosperous, if they had persecuti∣on, it was still prosperous: if Princes fa∣vored them, the World came in because the Christians lived holily; if Princes were in∣censed, the World came in because the Chri∣stians died bravely. They sought for death with greediness, they desired to be grinded in the teeth of Lions, and with joy they be∣held the wheels and the bended trees, the racks and the gibbets, the fires and the bur∣ning irons, which were like the chair of E∣lias to them, instruments to carry them to heaven, into the bosom of their beloved Jesus. Who would not acknowledge the Divi∣nity of this person, and the excellency of this institution, that should see Infants to weary the hands of Hangmen for the testimony of Jesus? and wise Men preach this doctrine for no other visible reward, but shame and death, poverty and banishment? and Hangmen converted by the blood of Mar∣tyrs Page  196 springing upon their faces which their impious hands & cords have strain'd through their flesh? who would not have confessed the honour of Jesus, when he should see mi∣racles done at the Tombs of Martyrs, and Devils tremble at the mention of the name of Jesus, and the World running to the ho∣nour of the poor Nazaren, and Kings and Queens killing the feet of the poor ser∣vants of Jesus? Could a few Fishermen and a Publican effect all this for the son of a poor Maiden of Judaea? can we suppose all the World, or so great a part of Man∣kind can consent by chance, or suffer such changes for nothing? or for any thing less than this? The son of the poor Maiden was the Son of God, and the Fishermen spake by a Divine spirit, and they catched the World with holiness and miracles, with wis∣dom and power bigger than the strength of all the Roman Legions. And what can be added to all this, but this thing alone to prove the Divinity of Jesus? He is a God, or at least is taught by God who can fore∣tell future contingencies; and so did the holy Jesus, and so did his Disciples. Our blessed Lord while he was alive fore∣told that after his death his Religion should Page  197 flourish more than when he was alive: He foretold Persecutions to his Disciples; he foretold the mission of the holy Ghost to be in a very few days after his Ascension, which within ten days came to pass; he pro∣phesied that the fact of Mary Magdalen in anointing the head and feet of her Lord, should be publick and known as the Gospel it self, and spoken of in the same place; he foretold the destruction of Jerusalem and the signs of its approach, and that it should be by War, and particularly after the manner of Prophets symbolically, nam'd the Nation should do it; pointing out the Roman Eagles, he foretold his death, and the manner of it, and plainly before-hand published his Resurrection, and told them it should be the sign to that generation, viz. the great argument to prove him to be the Christ, he prophesied that there should arise false Christs after him, and it came to pass to the extreme great calamity of the Na∣tion; and lastly, he foretold that his belo∣ved Disciple S. John should tarry upon the earth till his coming again, that is, to his coming to Judgment upon Jerusalem; and that his Religion should be preached to the Gentiles, that it should be scattered over Page  198 all the World, and be received by all Na∣tions, that it should stay upon the face of the Earth till his last coming to judge all the world, and that the gates of hell should not be able to prevail against his Church; which Prophecie is made good thus long, till this day, and is as a continual argument to justi∣fie the Divinity of the Author: The conti∣nuance of the Religion helps to continue it, for it proves that it came from God, who foretold that it should continue; and there∣fore it must continue because it came from God, and therefore it came from God be∣cause it does and shall for ever continue ac∣cording to the word of the holy Jesus. But after our blessed Lord was entred into glory, the disciples also were Prophets; Agabus foretold the dearth that was to be in the Roman Empire in the days of Clau∣dius Caesar, and that S. Paul should be bound at Jerusalem; S. Paul foretold the entring in of Hereticks into Asia after his depar∣ture; and he and S. Peter and S. Jude and generally the rest of the Apostles had two great predictions, which they used not on∣ly as a verification of the doctrine of Je∣sus, but as a means to strengthen the hearts of the Disciples who were so broken with Page  199 persecution: The one was, that there should arise a Sect of vile men who should be ene∣mies to Religion and Government, and cause a great Apostasie, which happened notoriously in the Sect of the Gnosticks, which those three Apostles and S. John no∣toriously and plainly do describe: And the other was, that although the Jewish Nation did mightily oppose the Religion, it should be but for a while, for they should be de∣stroyed in a short time, and their Nation made extremely miserable; but for the Chri∣stians, if they would fly from Jerusalem and go to Pella, there should not a hair of their head perish: the verification of this Pro∣phecy the Christians extremely long'd for and wondred it staid so long, and began to be troubled at the delay, and suspected all was not well, when the great proof of their Religion was not verified; and while they were in thoughts of heart concerning it, the sad Catalysis did come, and swept away 1100000. of the Nation, and from that day forward the Nation was broken in pieces with intolerable calamities, they are scat∣tered over the face of the earth, and are a va∣gabond Nation, but yet like oyl in a vessel of wine, broken into bubbles but kept in their Page  200 own circles, and they shall never be an uni∣ted people till they are servants of the ho∣ly Jesus; but shall remain without Priest or Temple, without Altar or Sacrifice, without City or Country, without the Land of Pro∣mise, or the promise of a blessing, till our Je∣sus is their high Priest, and the Shepherd to gather them into his fold: And this very thing is a mighty demonstration against the Jews by their own Prophets, for when Isai∣ah and Jeremiah, and Malachi had Prophe∣sied the rejection of the Jews and the call∣ing of the Gentiles, and the change of the old Law, and the introduction of a new by the Messias, that this was he, was therefore certain, because he taught the World a new Law, and presently after the publication of this, the old was abrogate, and not only went into desuetude, but into a total aboli∣tion among all the World, and for those of the remnant of the scattered Jews who obstinately blaspheme, the Law is become impossible to them, and they placed in such circumstances that they need not dis∣pute concerning its obligation: for it being external and corporal, ritual and at last made also local, when the circumstances are im∣possible, the Law that was wholly cere∣monial Page  201 and circumstantial must needs pass away, and when they have lost their Priest∣hood, they cannot retain the Law, as no man takes care to have his beard shaved when his head is off. And it is a wonder to consider how the anger of God is gone out upon that mise∣rable people, and that so great a blindness is fallen upon them, it being evident and notorious, that the old Testament was no∣thing but a shadow and umbrage of the new, that the Prophecies of that are plainly ve∣rified in this; that all the predictions of the Messias are most undeniably accomplished in the person of Jesus Christ, so that they cannot with any plausibleness or colour be turned any other way, and be applied to any other person, although the Jews make illiterate allegations, and prodigious dreams, by which they have fool'd them∣selves for 1600. years together, and still hope without reason, and are confident with∣out revelation, and pursue a shadow while they quit the glorious body; while in the mean time the Christian prays for his con∣version, and is at rest in the truth of Jesus, and hath certain unexpressible confidencies and internal lights, clarities of the holy Spi∣rit Page  202 of God, and loves to the holy Jesus produc'd in his soul, that he will die when he cannot dispute, and is satisfied and he knows not how, and is sure by comforts, and comforted by the excellency of his be∣lief, which speaks nothing but holiness, and light and reason, and peace and satisfacti∣ons infinite, because he is sure that all the World can be happy if they would live by the Religion of Jesus, and that neither so∣cieties of Men nor single persons can have felicity but by this, and that therefore God who so decrees to make Men happy, hath also decreed that it shall for ever be upon the face of the earth, till the earth it self shall be no more. Amen. Now if against this vast heap of things any Man shall but confront the pretences of any other Religion, and see how they fail both of reason and holiness, of wonder and Divinity, how they enter by force, and are kept up by humane interests, how ig∣norant and unholy, how unlearned and pi∣tiful are their pretences, the darknesses of these must add great eminency to the brightness of that. For the Jews Religion which came from Heaven is therefore not now to be practised, because it did come Page  203 from Heaven, and was to expire into the Christian, it being nothing but the image of this perfection; and the Jews needed no other argument but this, that God hath made theirs impossible now to be done, for he that ties to Ceremonies and outward u∣sages, Temples and Altars, Sacrifices and Priests, troublesome and expensive rites and figures of future signification, means that there should be an abode and fixt dwel∣ling, for these are not to be done by an am∣bulatory people; and therefore since God hath scattered the People into atomes and crumbs of society, without Temple or Priest, without Sacrifice or Altar, without Vrim or Thummim, without Prophet or Vision, even communicating with them no way but by ordinary providence, it is but too evident, that God hath nothing to do with them in the matter of that Religion, but that it is expired, and no way obligatory to them or pleasing to him which is become impos∣sible to be acted; whereas the Christian Religion is as eternal as the soul of a Man, and can no more cease than our spirits can die, and can worship upon Mountains and Caves, in Fields and Churches, in peace and war, in solitude and society, in persecution Page  204 and in Sun-shine, by night and by day, and be solemnized by Clergy and Laity in the essential parts of it, and is the perfection of the soul, and the highest reason of Man, and the glorification of God. But for the Heathen religions ir is evi∣dently to be seen, that they are nothing but an abuse of the natural inclination which all Men have to worship a God, whom be∣cause they know not, they guess at in the dark; for that they know there is and ought to be something that hath the care and pro∣vidence of their affairs. But the body of their Religion is nothing but little arts of Governments, and stratagems of Princes, and devices to secure the Government of new Usurpers, or to make obedience to the Laws sure, by being sacred, and to make the yoke that was not natural, pleasant by something that is. But yet for the whole body of it who sees not that their worship∣pings could not be sacred, because they were done by something that is impure, they appeased their gods with adulteries and im∣pure mixtures, by such things which Cato was ashamed to see, by gluttonous eatings of flesh, and impious drinkings, and they did litarein humano sanguine, they sacrificed Page  205 Men and Women and Children to their Da∣mons, as is notorious in the rites of Bac∣chus Omesta amongst the Greeks, and of Ju∣piter, to whom a Greek and a Greekess, a Galatian and a Galatess were yearly offer∣ed, in the answers of the Oracles to Caichas, as appears in Homer and Virgil; who sees not that crimes were warranted by the ex∣ample of their immortal gods, and that what did dishonor themselves, they sang to the honor of their gods, whom they affir∣med to be passionate and proud, jealous and revengeful, amorous and lustful, fearful and impatient, drunken and sleepy, weary and wounded, that the Religions were made lasting by policy and force, by ignorance, and the force of custom, by the preferring an inveterate error, and loving of a quiet and prosperous evil, by the arguments of pleasure, and the correspondencies of sen∣suality, by the fraud of Oracles, and the patronage of vices, and because they fear∣ed every change as an Earthquake, as sup∣posing overturnings of their old error to be the eversion of their well established Go∣vernments: and it had been ordinarily im∣possible that ever Christianity should have entered, if the nature and excellency of it Page  206 had not been such as to enter like rain in∣to a fleece of wool, or the Sun into a win∣dow without noise or violence, without emotion and disordering the political con∣stitution, without causing trouble to any man but what his own ignorance or peev∣ishness was pleased to spin out of his own bowels, but did establish Governments, se∣cure obedience, made the Laws firm, and the persons of Princes to be sacred; it did not oppose force by force, nor strike Prin∣ces for Justice; it defended it self against enemies by patience, and overcame them by kindness, it was the great instrument of God to demonstrate his power in our weaknesses, and to do good to Mankind by the imitation of his excellent goodness. Lastly, he that considers concerning the Religion and person of Mahomet, that he was a vicious person, lustful and tyrannical, that he propounded incredible and ridicu∣lous propositions to his Disciples, that it entred by the sword, by blood and vio∣lence, by murder and robbery, that it pro∣pounds sensual rewards and allures to com∣pliance by bribing our basest lusts, that it conserves it self by the same means it en∣tred; that it is unlearned and foolish, a∣gainst Page  207 reason, and the discourses of all wise Men, that it did no miracles and made false Prophecies: in short, that in the person that founded it, in the article it perswades, in the manner of prevailing, in the reward it offers it is unholy and foolish and rude; it, must needs appear to be void of all pre∣tence, and that no Man of reason can ever be fairly perswaded by arguments, that it is the daughter of God and came down from Heaven. Since therefore there is no∣thing to be said for any other Religion, and so very much for Christianity, every one of whose pretences can be proved as well as the things themselves do require, and as all the World expects such things should be proved; it follows that the holy Jesus is the Son of God, that his Religion is com∣manded by God, and is that way by which he will be worshipped and honoured, and that there is no other name under heaven by which we can be saved, but only by the name of the Lord Jesus. He that puts his soul up∣on this cannot perish; neither can he be re∣proved who hath so much reason and argu∣ment for his Religion. Sit anima mea cum Christianis; I pray God my soul may be numbred amongst the Christians. THE END.  "

IT is no strange thing To heare that the King Hath made his escapes; For Jove did the same, And got him a name (For shifting and Rapes.) What he did for Lust (For Jupiter must With a faire one sport.) King Charles did not doe, His Juno's no shrew, Hée's not gone to Court. No Danaes Power In a Brazen Tower Hath made him turn shower, You know well of old That he had no Gold,  C. R. was too poore. Nor ever did low For Europa-Cow, And feed among Beasts, Nor deceiv'd the Heards In a Goatish Beard, So quaint he was drest. But he is retir'd, As he was desir'd, For sweet Liberty. When every man claimes, And makes her his aimes, Won't you have Princes free? Away with such Knaves, Who Liberty craves, For their owne pure traines Yet would inviron Their King, and in Iron Binde him, and in chaines. We have heard in a manner Of the King and Tanner, But the King was first: But these Translators Of the State-matters, Make the King the worst. Instead of a Crowne, They'll pull him downe, As not fit for trust; Instead of God save, His life they will have, And's Honourith'dust. Salt Peters, and Dell,  You have preached well To your Auditory: This Doctrine you may Read in Loyola;  Here's a fine story. Would any man thinke, The Agitators drinke Of the waters of Tiber? Or that Babylons whore Were Peters Paramour, Or Dells next Neighbour? Protestant God night, Welcome Jesuite, Welcome pretty Nuns, Our Daughters shall be Whores of Pietie, And Rebells our Sons.  Charles keep in thy Cloud, And there safe thee shrewd, Nor break, but as Day. The mid Region be Thy Artillerie, Where Clouds beare the sway. Peep a little from thence, And list to what sense Wee make of thy Letters, Every one doth think That great Caesars Inke, Never wrot better. And as for the matter, We cannot here flatter, The Royall Inditer, But say, as true 'tis, Thy Pen (as was his) Is of a ready Writer. We're sorry to see, That such Treacherie Should be in our Land; Or that any thing Should force our good King To his running hand, His Letters he throwes, Like Parthian Arrowes,  And Conquers flying. Ten thousand are sold, They 'll never be old. New, new news they're crying. D' you see, do you see, How the Presbyterie Joy their f•••t named, The Assembly men prinke Up their Eares; I thinke They were neare maimed. But be not too cranke In the second ranke, The Independents Will look to your waters, And then follow after Th' Army their defendents. Satisfaction's next, To his party perplext, And gone to the Pot, 'Cause th' have adhered, And are to be feared, And even the Scot. Now marke his Len voy,  And cry Vive-le-Roy;  Can any thinke so, God will blesse those Peeres Who refuse to heare Their King? Surely no. As hee's Royall to all, So he Personall Is honest, and just, In his care you see For deliverie Of his Pictures in trust. There's none but a King, Could doe such a thing, Who is Princely bent, Truely to restore, (Who can doe any more? What the Ladies lend. O most gallant Prince, Whose free Conscience, No euill shall clog, He does Whaly beseech, To send home the Grew Bitch, Before he will jog. And his deportment Shewes afore he went, Him a Gentleman much; Who would not neglect His civill respects To Whaly and such. So did he thinke fit,  Mountague to greet. And's fellowes, whose fames Were good, and discourses And so were the horses, He sent his sonne James.  His Letters all done, Away he is gone, And leaves these Papers.

There was a bright starre. What wonders are here? Yet we doe not feare, High-minded and proud; Nor our sinnes revoke, Yet see Stars in a Cloak, And Kings in a Cloud. Now we're all at a gaze, To discover which wayes This Angell was gone, Where more him attend, God did his Guards send, And ease those at Hampton.  God keep our C. R.  From Martin-King-marre, And such evill sprights, Who have late brought in That cursed Doctrine, With their new-found lights, But thou blessed Isle, That preservest a while Thy King, be thou wise, Doe not thou betray, Nor open thy Bay, Nor suffer surprize.

BAN∣CROFTS RASHNES A∣GAINST THE CHVRCH OF SCOTLAND. MEN of anie sound iudge∣mente (good Sir) that hard or read that decla∣mation made at Paules Crosse the 9. of Februa∣rie, 1588. in time of Parlament, by RICHARD BANCROFT, D. of Diuinity, and chap∣laine, &c, (as he will needs be styled) and afterward enlarged by him, and set forth in print, may easily perceiue that (small regard had to godly edifiyng, by the right cutting of that worthy text of Scripture. Beleeue not euerie Spirit, &c. 1. IOHN. 4. 1. which then hee tooke to entreate) he made the whol drift of his speach, to serue his intended turne, for a bitter inuection against the godlie brethren of Englande, who vrge Reformation of that Churche, and chiefly, the remoouing of that heauie Page  [unnumbered] bondage of Antichristian gouernment by loftie Lordes, wrongfully called Bishops, (an hurtfull relicke of Romish confusion) & restoring in the place thereof, the ioynt administration of Christian Discipline by the Ministers and Elders of the Churche, which is most clearely prooued by them and others, to be established by the word of GOD, to continue to the comming of the Lord Iesus Christ: whose godly ende∣uours, when for a while he hath laboured to improoue, after his maner, hee leaueth the matter in question at last altogeather, and setteth himself against theyr persons, and trauaileth with tooth and naile (as they say) to bring them into extreame ha∣tred with the supreme Magistrate, as men who by this their new gouernment (so it pleaseth him to speake of it) intend no les matter then hie Treason and rebellion, by ouerthrowing her Majesties authority in Ecclesiasticall causes, and highly deroga∣ting thereby, to her supreamacie in that case, to the apparant indangering of her person and state in the end, except good order bee taken with the matter in time: Then the which, what can bee more odi∣ously affirmed, and more woorthy of ex∣treme Page  [unnumbered] punishment, if it be true. But how doth he prooue all this geare I pray you? euen from his owne feare for∣sooth, which riseth vpon his falsly conie∣ctured suspicions, without al groundes of truth, to wit, that as outlandish meanes & practises haue bene traiterous and rebel∣lious, in erecting and establishing of this new gouernement (as he speaketh) so hee feareth, that they, who so exactly, and with such hoat persuit, follow the outlan∣dish preceptes in this case, will fall to the same meanes in England, pag. of his book 83. 84. and least his credite should come in question, for abusing his auditors with vntruthes in this matter, he wil not seeme to speake any thing without his warrand: and therefore finding nothing to charge the good breethren at hoame withall in this case: (such is the mercy of GOD to∣ward them, that the very aduersarie him∣selfe, seeking matter of accusation against them, can finde no hole in their coat, doe his best, but by his vnwilling silence, is compelled, in a manner, to iustifie their dewtifull modestie, in seeking Reformati∣on hitherto.) Not being able then I say, to finde any thing against the brethren of Page  [unnumbered] Englande in this case (for otherwise they shoulde haue heard of it, ye may bee sure) he raungeth abroad, and as a stranger cu∣rious in an other Commonweale, making choise, especially of Scotland, hee setteth vpon it with al his maine, assuring himself of sure proof of his purpose from thence, Pag. 72. In doing whereof, as he most out∣ragiously vpbraideth our whole Ministe∣rie, & Christian Discipline of our church, with a cartful of calumneis, vtered against them both: So he cannot refrain himselfe from most reprochfull slaundering of the K. Majestie himselfe, as after shal be seen, and disdaineful contemning of the whole inhabitants of the land. A perrilous pra∣ctise (whose Chaplaine so euer hee be) a∣gainst the happie amitie between the two Realmes, especially now, in these daunge∣rous daies, wherein our common peace is so highly indangered, aswel by the dome∣sticque male-contens and conspirators at home, as by the forraine detected enemy abroad: good men in the meane time pil∣lers, as it were, and chiefe intertainers thereof, daily waxing fewer and fewer in both the lands. Neuerthelesse, so egar is the man in the Page  [unnumbered] matter, that before hee will not bring his stick to the fire, he will not spare to speake euil, euen, of those things which he know∣eth not, and verye boldelye, though most rashly, builde vppe an vglie heape of most slanderous accusations against our sayde Church, and that vpon the false testimo∣nies of the friuelous reports of other mē, and chiefly of two, the very bare naming of whom, where they are knowne, is suffi∣cient ynough of it selfe, to discredit what∣soeuer is alleadged in their names: For as touching the former of them, corruptlie and falslie called Bishop of S. Androis,* it is much better that the legend of his leud life bee buried in eternall obliuion, then that Christian eares should bee polluted with the vnsauorie mention thereof. Al∣though it is not hard to gesse, the whole course of his proceedings (as a Lyon may bee knowen by his clawes) by one spe∣•iall action. For what will that man be a∣shamed to doe, that durst father his owne forgerie vppon the Lords lieuetenant the K. Majestie himselfe, and that in a matter of no lesse importance, then the declarati∣on of the meaning of some acts of Parlia∣ment, which howbeit it was but his own Page  [unnumbered] declaration (as his Majestie hath plainely witnessed by his own hand writ yet extant to be seene) and not the Kings. Yet durst he bee bolde to giue it out in the Kinges name, as though, hee had beene the verie vndouted author therof: If this be not to play the falsarie forger, & that in the hiest degree, let the Chaplain himself be judge. But here hee will replie, that this is but our Ministers affirmation (who saith hee, page 75. dare say what they list.) Other∣wise, as the declaration is the Kings: so, as for the King, he is not altered. Ictus pi∣scator sapit, &c. Whereby he will not only haue that counterfeit and bastard decla∣ration bound on the Kinges backe, whe∣ther he will or not: But before it shall not be so, he dare be bold, in the same page a∣boue cited, to charge his Majestie with deepe dissimulation, while in effect, he af∣firmeth, that howbeit the king by his wri∣ting, speaking, and actions, would seeme to approoue the present exercise of that same discipline, which so flatly is condem∣ned in that foresaid declaration: yet hee doth not approue it in hart, because (saith the Chaplaine) hee is not altered, to wit, from that thing which he would haue him Page  [unnumbered] to haue set downe in that declaration, flat contrary to his present practise, allowing it after al the waies foresaid. In the which saying, hee necessarily dooth implie deepe dissimulation to be in his Majestie, while hee will haue him to condemne that in heart, which in deed so manifestly he doth allow: let it be judged then, whether it be our ministers that speak as they list, or he. It had become his person and place to haue spoken & written, at the least, more reuerently of his Majestie, how vncharita∣blie so euer hee had judged of him in his mind: yea, charitie would haue made him thinke with himselfe (if there had beene a sponke thereof within him) that nowe be∣ing of perfect age, and yeres of discretion, he is christianlie mooued in singlenesse of hart, by his auctority to approue that chri¦stian discipline, which nowe he cleerely se∣eth to be so well warranted by the worde of God, which perhaps in his minority & none age (being misled by crafty men) he did not so perfitly vnderstand. But let not his maiestie, nor any prince, looke for any better dealing at the handes of any of his coat, when their honor, & these mens pro∣fites come into their way to be ballanced. Page  [unnumbered] But God be praised, it hath pleased his maiestie, not to winke at this malapert ca∣lumny, but to note it with a coale, to their confusion that allowed of that lye, while by his owne hande writ, set downe in the margent of BANCROFTS book, page fore∣said, iust ouer aboue these his most impu∣dent assertions. For the K. he is not alte| red: Ictus Piscator sapit. his crown & their soueraignty will not agree together, most plainely hee declareth the singlenes of his hart in this behalf, flat cōtrary to these im∣pudent assertions in the words following. MY SPEAKING, VVRITING, AND ACTIONS, VVERE AND ARE EVER ONE, VVITHOVT DISSEMBLING, OR BEARING VP AT ANY TIME, VVHAT EVER I THOVGHT. Whereby, as he purgeth him selfe of al dissembling in times past, so hee protest∣eth, that his speaking, writing, and actions in approuing the present exercise of Disci∣pline, are fully agreeing to his thought & minde, and therefore hee concludeth in these wordes following. Ergo CASTS THE LIBEL, nequid asperius. Which is as much to say, as, wherefore the D. assertions are vntrue, to vse no Page  [unnumbered] rougher tearmes, which after his accusto∣med maner, is subscribed as followeth: I. R. That is, Iacobus Rex. Which wordes vttered in Scottish after this sorte, if the Chaplaine shall goe about to misconstrue, or wrangle from this his true meaning, his M. hath faithfully pro∣mised to giue him such a categoricke, and simple answer by a plain lie in round eng∣lish, as shall make him, and al his maintai∣ners in this cause, to be ashamed that euer they medled with this matter. Thus god recompenseth the foolish, while hee ma∣keth deceite to returne into the harte of them that forge euil. And touchinge that truthles TVRI∣NVS, of whome the Chaplain had the pa∣terne of this pagean: he is presently as far out of his maiesties fauour (let the Bisho∣pists of England trust the intelligence gi∣uen by him to them of the contrary, so much as they lift) as euer before he semed to be in it. But whether he shal receaue the like recompense in the end, that that his predecessor did, at the the handes of that worthy emperor Alexander Seuerus, while being fastened to a stake, the cryer stoode thus crying to the people, smoke he solde, Page  [unnumbered] and with smoke he is punished, it resteth to his maiesties discretion to consider. But yet I thinke that soe the Chaplaine will not let goe his holde: but wil alledge that in noe wise hee is to bee blamed for building vppon the testimony of this his author, in that declaration at least (what euer the man be otherwise) seeing, so pub∣lickly & vniuersally, in a maner, it was re∣ceiued by many of his betters, for the K. owne declaratiō, in so much, yt it was prin∣ted again, & reprinted with a most odious preface at London, without any controle∣ment, in so far as it cōcerned vs, red, & re∣marked diligētly by many, & vigilantly in∣sinuated to the view of som chief persona∣ges of the state, who were made so to like of it, & to thinke it to be of truth, like to som new gospel, that som, not of the most inferior of such, whoe are called children of the most high amonge them, haue not spared, as we heare, to take boldnes ther∣by of late, in their publict Iudiciary trials reprochfully, to vpbraid our countrimen, in the persons of such as were tried before them, comparing them to Scottish men, who when the K. proclaimed a feast, wold needes haue a fast, or contrariwise, when Page  [unnumbered] the K. wold haue a feast, they proclaimed a fast, alluding to that false narration, tou∣ching the banketting of the French Am∣bassadour, set downe in that counterfait declaration. And last of al, for the perpe∣tual triumphing memory thereof against vs, it was insert, worde for worde, in the Chronicle of England, cōpiled by HOLIN∣SHED, and published to the posteritie in print. To the which I answer, that as the multitude of offenders authoriseth not an errour: so he shoulde not haue follow∣ed a multitude to doe euill, much lesse shoulde hee haue added euil to euil, and done worse then any that went before him: but before the publishing of so waighty a matter after such a maner, hee should without partiality haue examined the truthe of the thing to the bottome: and not otherwise so impotentlye haue suffered him selfe, to haue bene caryed a∣way through the apish Imitation of men, perfitly knowne to him to be partially af∣fected in this case: yea, and to speake fur∣ther, howbeit the most part of the things contained in that slanderous libel, after due trial, had bin founde true, yet charity would rather haue buried, euen, the mul∣titude Page  [unnumbered] of sins, then so bitterly haue blown abroad some ouersights, to the reproch of a whole reformed church. What could the veriest Papist of them al haue done more? But what should be said to a bellie that hath no eares, that poore DEMAS (if he be no woorse) hunting appearandly for promotion to some Prelacie (as the man∣ner is) is so incorporate with that compa∣nie of climers to preferment (as they call it) and imbracers of this present worlde, that he is as corrupt, & partial in this case, as the proudest of them: so that of one, ye may learne all: Otherwise, if there had bene but a sponke of sincere judgement in him: as worthelie hee might haue suspe∣cted that marueilous heape of most hor∣rible accusations, to haue bene incredible in a Churche, namely, where so long the truth hath beene sincerely preached and professed: So, he needed not to thinke it a∣ny strange or new thing, for crafty miscre∣ants, hauiug credit in Court, and church, to finde the meanes many times, to abuse the names of Princes and excellent men: yea, and of God himselfe, as cloakes to couer their diuelish, and naughty deuises. Whereof, let these examples be witnesses, Page  [unnumbered] to wit, of IOAB, IES ABEL, HAMAN, GEHASI, the old Prophet of Bethel, and all the false Prophets, false Apostles, and false teachers that euer spake, or speak the vision of their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord: and who ran and runne when the Lord hath not sent them. And last, touching the printing againe and reprinting of that forged declaration at London, and ioyning it to the chronicle of England, where through some, whome the Lorde hath called Gods, thinking all cock sure, take occasion of vpbraiding the Ministerie of our Countrie when it plea∣seth them: As these shall die ignominious∣ly like men, except they repent: So, what honour those haue procured thereby to their Country, & what credit to the chro∣nicle therof, let them brag of it, when the vprightnes of our cause sufficiently clea∣red by this and the like writings, shall iu∣stifie it selfe to their faces, and the true storie thereof, that shall remaine registred to all posterities, shall witnesse the honesty and duetifull dealing of our Church in al things, to their shame. Thus much then being spoken, touch∣ing the former of the Chaplains two wit∣nesses: Page  [unnumbered] let vs nowe come to the other, his inconstant Countrey-man (as hee descri∣beth him,* for as for mee, hee shall bee no woorse, then he himselfe maketh him) the naming of whome, belike, might doe his cause more harme, then his testimony can doe it good, and therefore he contenteth him self, with a very slender description of him: so that not without a note of reproch in the end he sendes him packing in these wordes following. This mans opinion heerein (saith he) I knowe wilbe greately contemned, because I thinke hee hath bin of an other judgement, &c. Howebeit let him finde what fauour at their handes he shall: I must indeede confesse, that if this matter had onely depended vppon his re∣port or opinion: I would not at this time haue made mention of him. Wherby you see what a wethercock he maketh of him, and howe rediculously he leaueth him, to beg credite where hee may finde it, for he can giue him none. Here I omitt to make mention of the Iar, that is fallen out since betweene our Chapleine, and his subor∣ned witnes, for that, that vpon no fair pro∣mise of recompense, hee coulde procure newe furniture at his hands, of some more Page  [unnumbered] particular matter against the newe onset, that with long preparation he hath inten∣ded against vs: Seeing then, that no mans pen nor tong can more discredite this his second witnes, then he doth him self (part∣ly by the wordes aboue rehearsed, & part∣ly by the D. words following in his decla∣mation, where he flatly again maketh him to be of a changeable humor.) If he drink no better by his meanes, then hee hath brewed, let him blame himself, vnderstan∣ding that euil aduise is worst to the adui∣ser: I will not speake at this time of the shameles falsehoode that is alleadged out of the testimonye it selfe, which whensoe∣uer it shalbe particularly examined, will make the D. repent that euer hee cited such a testimony, & specially, where most impudently it is affirmed, that hee hath knowne the Kinge in greate danger, and feare of his life by their lordly Discipline, the contrary whereof, as it is cleerely kno∣wen to al the worthie persons, Ambassa∣dors of England, who haue had their long residence here amonge vs, and priuate in∣telligence of al our affaires, after an other manner, then euer his wandring witnesse coulde attaine vnto: so is it many wayes Page  [unnumbered] affirmed by the K. himselfe, and daylie experience, God be praised, doth confirm the same. Both the Chaplaines authors then, be∣ing such prettie fellowes, as hath bin de∣clared, I trust it be not hard to bee seene, how little credit is to bee giuen to his de∣clamation, grounded vppon their railing reports (to leaue the demōstration of the falshood of the matter vttered by them, to the owne time and place.) For he should haue considered, that of how little credit soeuer he was himselfe, yet it behoued his witnesses to be free of infamy, according to the saying, a Proctor may be infamous, but not a witnes. But it seemeth, that ei∣ther he was not greatly careful of his own name, who would repose vppon the crac∣ked credits of such defamed persons, in so waighty a matter, or els he thought (as GYGES did, by means of his ring) to walke inuisible, as in a cloud, that none could or would espy his nakednes. But good man, he is far deceiued, as by the answere to his seuerall asseuerations (if neede be) more throughly & sensibly he shall vnderstand. It is easie then to be seene, how far short the Chaplaine hath come in probation of Page  [unnumbered] the alleadged treasonable outlandish pra∣ctises, of men of the new gouernment (as scoffingly he calleth the vrgers of Refor∣mation) whereof he would seeme to take such feare, that except good order be ta∣ken to preuent the like at hoame, thinges will grow to some extremities, pag. of his booke 83. And therefore I trust the Q. M. and her honorable Councell, will see this surmised proposition of danger of outlan∣dish practises, by the meanes of Christian Discipline, to be somwhat better proued, before they will feare any danger to insue to their state through the same: yea, and I thinke, if they knew, but euen so much, as heere truly I haue set downe to you (Sir) in this short discourse, touching this mat∣ter, as the cause of christian disciplin shuld euen be the better liked of them all, seing it, & the fauorers of it, to be so shamefully belied: So the D. patrons in this case, shuld pride themselues but a little, of that slan∣derous declamation, & thinke them and their cause but smally beholden vnto it, what euer hath bene their opinion there∣of before. For let any wise man iudge, if one eg can be more like another, then the D. maner Page  [unnumbered] of reasoning is to that forme: that REHVM SHIMSHAI, & the rest of the mē bejond the riuer, vsed in a letter to K. ART AHSHASH∣TE, for hindering the building of Ierusa∣lem, EZ. 4. saue only, that the iudgemēt of them beyond the riuer, was found to be in the authentik bokes of the chronicles, ac∣cording as was alleadged by them: & our chaplains argumēt leaneth only vpon the counterfeit, & forged chartales of known and confessed infamous persons, & a false Chronical grounded thereupon. Where∣fore, if their authentike books of Chroni∣cles, did not truly conuince Ierusalem to be a rebellious citie to kings and prouin∣ces, of what force should this Chaplaines infamous libel be (I pray you) against the good brethren of England, to proue that they will be rebellious to their Princes, if that christiā disciplin be admitted to haue place within that land? For as Ierusalem was not a rebellious citie to kings & pro∣uinces indeed, howbeit the books of their Chronicles did beare so: So the exercisers of christian discipline in Scotland, are not necessarily to be accounted rebellious to the K. for exercising of the same, howbe∣it, the bookes of the register of the acts of Page  [unnumbered] Scotland did containe the same. Howe much lesse then, ought false surmised for∣geries of known infamous men haue cre∣dite in that case? And if the enuy of the sect of the Naza∣rites vrged by prophane TERTVLLVS, is not sufficient to beare downe PAVLE, as a seditious mouer of the people, because he professed, preached, and followed Iesus of Nazaret, whom the Iewes most iniustly & wickedly slewe, as a seditious person, and blasphemer, by the meanes of two sub∣borned false witnesses, Why should the good brethren of England, that seeke re∣formation, be charged with a mind here∣after of sedition, by the meanes of Disci∣pline, because the Church of Scotland, in respect of the same Discipline exercised in it, is vniustlie, condemned of sedition, by the hie Priests of our daies, two false wit∣nesses being alleaged for that purpose, by their TERTVLLVS at Pauls Crosse? I see no reason why they should. Let not the com∣parison be odious, because, I compare not the persons in themselues, but in the cau∣ses, which haue their own likenes & agre∣ment in some proportion. I haue insisted the more in this matter, bicaus, your cause Page  [unnumbered] and ours, are most neer linked togeather. For the aduersaries would terrifie her M. frō admitting of christian discipline with∣in her realm, for fear of like inconuenien∣ces to fal out therby to her quiet gouern∣mēt, which are falsly alledged to haue fal∣lē out by the same, to our K. & state. How be it, it be not good logicke, to charge the good cause of discipline, with any infamy, by reason of the faults of the Ministers & fauourers thereof, yea, euen put case they were sufficiently proued, seeing that is but a sophisme from the person to the cause, (as they say) How much lesse then, ought it to be condemned, when the aduersaries ar not able, do their best, to blot euen the persons, by accusing of whom, they labor to cōdemne the cause. But I perswade my selfe, that all this their paralogizing, and false maner of reasoning shal helpe them, and hurt vs as little in the ende, as the so∣phistry of REHVM and his companions be∣yond the riuer, helped their cause, & hin∣dred the bulding of the Temple: & as the smooth Rhetoricke of TERTVLLVS, pre∣uailed not against PAVLE, no more shall their course alwaies preuaile against the good cause in Englande. Wherefore, let Page  [unnumbered] GAI and ZACHARIAS do their parts faith∣fully, and without fainting, exhort al men acording to their callings, to further this holy building, not doubting, but God in his time, shall mooue DARIVS fully to au∣thorise the building of Ierusalem: howbe∣it, through the injury of these daies, men may bee forced to leaue of building for a season: And let PAVL stand stoutly to the defence of his iust cause, saying confident∣ly: Neither can they prooue the thinges, whereof now they accuse me. Act. 24. 13. And TERTVLLVS, & his maintainers shall finde themselues disappointed, and PAVL by little, and litle, shal grow to some grea∣ter liberty, and his cause shall preuaile in the end. But nowe let vs come, accordinge to your desire, to the causes why that decla∣mation of D. BANCROFTS, so far as concer∣ning Scotland, is not answered, wherein howbeit I am not to prejudge the church of Scotland, yet for your further satisfacti∣on, I haue thought good to set downe the causes of the delay, so far as euer I coulde learn or perceiue. And first you may be as∣sured that it was not for lacke of habilitie in the meanest of a thousand in Scotlande Page  [unnumbered] to haue confuted that calūnious chartale, fraughted with as many lyes almost, as it hath lines,* that it was not answered: how∣soeuer it pleaseth som of your grand DD. (very learned men,* ye may be sure, if they be not far deceued) reprochefully to point out some of our wel approoued brethren, and especially one, by the note, of like an vnlearned, yea then, a very vnlerned Scot: Whome yet notwithstanding they neuer hard nor sawe, more then D. BANCROFTE did heare and see the Church of Scotland, and the things wherewith most rashly hee doth charge it: But who is so bold, as they say, as blind bayard. Yet if any ARISTAR∣CHVS among them, hath taken occasion of the writing of anye brother here, so to speake, let it bee judged by the learned, what iust cause he had so to do: & I doubt not, but he shalbe found to haue had litle learning, and lesse conscience in so doing, which is spoken, not so much for the Apo∣logy of any man at this time: as to note the disdainefull contempt of these hauty persons. For he must be of very rare lear∣ning, as not a few can beare me witnes, in whom this sort (for I speake not of all) of the generation of Bishopists will acknow∣ledge Page  [unnumbered] any learning to be, if once directlie and seriously, he oppone himselfe to their pride: For as there is nothing, wherin they commonly boast them selues more, then in the beard, & shew of learning: as thogh who forsooth but they onely: So is there no shaft that oftner flieth out of their bag against others, then the boult of lack lear∣ning. Howbeit, if it were not for auoiding of vncomly, and vnchristian rendering of reproch, for reproch, it were no hard ma∣ter shortly to decipher the profound sci∣ence of those two especially, who were chief authors of that reproch, & to let thē vnderstand, of what form & classe among the learned, learned men indeede, did euer esteeme them to bee, notwithstan∣ding, all the windye volumes written by them: For Scribimus indocti doctique, &c. Howbeit, yet I deny not so much know∣ledge vnto them otherwise, as shall bee a witnes against them, if they vse it not bet∣ter, & as might profit the Church in some measure, if they had grace to imploy it to the right end. But to returne to our purpose, as the answer was not delaied, for lacke of suffi∣cient qualified men amongest vs for that, Page  [unnumbered] & for a greater purpose, God be praised, if need be: so it was thought needles, & su∣perfluous, here amongst our selues, where the truth of those things alledged in that Pamphlet were so clearly known, as there needed no other confutation of them, then the shamelesse impudencie of them∣selues: And as for the answere, in respect of others, it was delaied first, as I take it, for auoiding of vnhappy contention, that is woont to arise vppon suche occasions, wherby it might haue come to passe, that daungerous alteration might haue bene wrought betweene the two Realmes, as a godly and wise man of yours, commen∣ding the discretion of our mē in that case, did not conceal, in a letter written to som of good account in our Countrey, not long ago. For the firebrand of selfeloue, and great ardency of men, in defending their owne sayings & doings whatsoeuer, suffereth thē not many times, so much to regard the truth and peace of the church, as their own stincking estimation: where∣of, there is too great proofe in manifolde lamentable examples, aswell of antiquity, as of our own daies, both far and neer, to the timely admonition of vs all, if adui∣sedly Page  [unnumbered] we consider of the counsaile of gods spirite, saying: The beginning of strife, is as one that openeth the waters, therefore or the contention be meddled with, leaue off: Which howbeit more fitly, it may be applied to the aduersaries (in this case) the persuers then to our Church, yet no man I trust, can blame the Ministerie of Scotlande, to regard it greatly, so long as there is any hope that the truth, and their innocencie may be in faftie without their answere: otherwise, they are not ignorant, that, there is no les danger, alwais to keep silence, then neuer, as HILARIE speaketh. Secondly, the answere was deferred, as I take it, in hope of due redresse to be put to that offence by the Q. M. and her Honourable Counsaile, who our men thought (as they thinke yet) esteemed so of their friendship, that they wold not suf∣fer them to lie vnder any opprobrie vn∣remooued, so farre as lay in them, neither would suffer them to receiue any iniurie vncorrected, at the hands of any whome they might command: For there are not many years past, since it plesed her M. not without signification of a thankful mind, by her letters, to acknowledge the Mini∣sters Page  [unnumbered] of Scotlād by name, to be hir most lo∣uing & trusty frends in Christ (as yet God be praised they cōtinue to this day, which is not vnknown to her M. & faithful coun∣sellers) in regard whereof, they yet expect the due amendement of that wrong, and that so much the more, as they haue bene put in hope thereof, from thence by writ, purposly written to that effect, from some great personages, who, howbeit nowe they rest from their labours (to the no small forewarning of the present state of Englande, if the matter be well marked) yet our men think, that they shal not lack such fauour in that Counsaile, as shal pro∣cure redresse of that iniury in due season, in respect of the good opinion they vn∣derstande (and that euen by writ of late) her Majestie and Counsaile, yet retaine of the Ministery of Scotland, & their christi∣an friendship toward them, & that estate. Thirdly and last, a secret bridle of God (who ruleth the actions of men acording to the dispensation of his prouidēce) stai∣ed thē from answering, for causes known onely to himselfe, as they so sensiblie in a manner haue perceiued (especially they, who were priuie to the matter) that the Page  [unnumbered] knowledge thereof, may sufficiently satis∣fie the minde of any modest man, who wil acknowledge the prouident dispensa∣tion of God to be such, as howsoeuer the heart of man purposeth his waye, yet the Lord doth direct his steps. This much I thought meet (good Sir) to impart vnto you, touching the dange∣rous rashnes of D. BANCROFT, in slande∣ring our whole Church so vnaduisedly, af∣ter such a publicke manner, and that vp∣pon the naked reportes, of two such infa∣mous witnesses (partlye, by manifest de∣monstration of trecherous dealing in one of them, and partly by his owne confessi∣on, touching the other) as are not to haue credite against any particular Christian, much les, against a whole Church, a King, and a Realme: As also touching the cau∣ses of the deferring of the answere there∣vnto, so far as I vnderstand, which things, if they were known to the D. and his com∣plices, (but euen as heere rudely they are set downe) they might peraduenture let them haue experience (which is a fooles, though not a foolishe maister) that they haue run to far headlong into these slan∣derous and new deuises: and so hearafter Page  [unnumbered] might learne more aduisedly and charita∣blie, to deale with their neighbours and brethren, who haue deserued no suche things at their hands: Yea, it is very like, if these same things were read, or summa∣rily and shortly reported in her Majesties hearing, either by your selfe, or som other good Christian, who hath credite and fa∣uour about her royall person (For alack good princesse, the trew report of things, especially in these & the like maters, com∣meth seldome to her eares, a common ca∣lamitie of princes, whoe commonly of all others in the world, are most destitute of faithful persons aboute them, trewlie and without flattery to informe them of the truth of matters as they are in deede.) If these things, I say, were truly known to her M. I surely perswade my selfe, that those lordly brethren of DIOTREPHES, who rule or rather tyrannise aboue their brethren with violence & cruelty, should be quick∣ly charmed from authorising such rashe libertie of publicke rayling, and defa∣ming of a whol neighbour church, which alway hath so well deserued of the pre∣sent state of Englande, and their proude hornes should be hastely hamered downe, Page  [unnumbered] that they should not be able hereafter, to thrust with side and shoulder, and push all the weake with their hornes, til they haue scattered them abroad, and to make such hauocke of the Churche, by a disguised persecution, as presently they doe: Yea this much at least, I doubt not shoulde be graunted, that (all bitter inuection and persecuting of the good brethren of Eng∣land, that are of the same judgment with vs,* surceasing) the controuersie should be decided by the word of God in a law∣full assemblie, and brotherlie conference, appointed by the supreme Magistrates to that effect: Otherwise, if this come not to passe (which God forbid) as we must not cease to commend the troubled estate of those our christian brethren, to GOD in our priuate and publicke praiers, so must we not leaue the iust defence of our ho∣nest cause of Christian Discipline, which (touching the substance thereof, whiche chiefly is in controuersie) hath no les war∣rand to be continued perpetually within the Church, vnder this precept of Christ, feede my sheepe, then hath the preaching of the worde, and ministration of the Sa∣craments, and so consequently floweth Page  [unnumbered] no more from the authoritie of the Ciuill Magistrate then they doe, whateuer for∣mall professours in worde, but not ad∣mitters of the yoake of Christ on their neks indeed, cry out to the contrary. This much (good Sir) I thought good by writ to answere to your letter, after this man∣ner, here before set downe, both to satisfie you and others, touching this matter in some measure, which if it shall seeme good to you, ye, either by your selfe, or by some other, may briefly impart vnto her M. Farewell,  from Edin.the 18. of September. 1590. Yours in the Lord. I. D.  Page  [unnumbered] "
